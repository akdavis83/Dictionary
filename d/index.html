            <p>Syn.
             — Darkness, Dimness, Obscurity, Gloom. Darkness arises from a
            total, and dimness from a partial, want of light. A thing is obscure
            when so overclouded or covered as not to be easily perceived. As tha
            shade or obscurity increases, it deepens into gloom. What is dark is
            hidden from view; what is obscure is difficult to perceive or
            penetrate; the eye becomes dim with age; an impending storm fills the
            atmosphere with gloom. When taken figuratively, these words have a
            like use; as, the darkness of ignorance; dimness of discernment;
            obscurity of reasoning; gloom of superstition.</p>

            <p>Note: This theory was put forth by Darwin in 1859 in a work entitled
            "The Origin of species by Means of Natural Selection." The author
            argues that, in the struggle for existence, those plants and
            creatures best fitted to the requirements of the situation in which
            they are placed are the ones that will live; in other words, that
            Nature selects those which are survive. This is the theory of natural
            selection or the survival of the fillest. He also argues that natural
            selection is capable of modifying and producing organisms fit for
            their circumstances. See Development theory, under Development.</p>

            from its name and date on the other side.</p>
            <p> Speaking generally, the date line coincides with the meridian 180º
            from Greenwich. It deflects between north latitudes 80º and 45º, so
            that all Asia lies to the west, all North America, including the
            Aleutian Islands, to the east of the line; and between south
            latitudes 12º and 56º, so that Chatham Island and the Tonga group lie
            to the west of it. A vessel crossing this line to the westward sets
            the date forward by one day, as from Sunday to Monday. A vessel
            crossing the line to the eastward sets the date back by one day, as
            from Monday to Sunday. Hawaii has the same day name as San Francisco;
            Manila, the same day name as Australia, and this is one day later

            Francisco it is Tuesday may 2d at Manila.</p>

            <p>DEATH
            Death, n. Etym: [OE. deth, dea, AS. deá; akin to OS. d, D. dood, G.
            tod, Icel. dau, Sw. &amp; Dan. död, Goth. daupus; from a verb meaning to
            die. See Die, v. i., and cf. Dead.]</p>
            <p>1. The cessation of all vital phenomena without capability of
            resuscitation, either in animals or plants.</p>
            <p>Note: Local death is going on at times and in all parts of the living
            body, in which individual cells and elements are being cast off and
            replaced by new; a process essential to life. General death is of two
            kinds; death of the body as a whole (somatic or systemic death), and
            death of the tissues. By the former is implied the absolute cessation
            of the functions of the brain, the circulatory and the respiratory
            organs; by the latter the entire disappearance of the vital actions
            of the ultimate structural constituents of the body. When death takes
            place, the body as a whole dies first, the death of the tissues
            sometimes not occurring until after a considerable interval. Huxley.</p>
            <p>2. Total privation or loss; extinction; cessation; as, the death of

            <p>Syn.
             — Death, Decrase, Departure, Release. Death applies to the
            termination of every form of existence, both animal and vegetable;
            the other words only to the human race. Decease is the term used in
            law for the removal of a human being out of life in the ordinary
            course of nature. Demise was formerly confined to decease of princes,
            but is now sometimes used of distinguished men in general; as, the
            demise of Mr. Pitt. Departure and release are peculiarly terms of
            Christian affection and hope. A violent death is not usually called a
            decease. Departure implies a friendly taking leave of life. Release
            implies a deliverance from a life of suffering or sorrow.</p>

            <p>Syn.
             — Debility, Infirmity, Imbecility. An infirmity belongs, for the
            most part, to particular members, and is often temporary, as of the
            eyes, etc. Debility is more general, and while it lasts impairs the
            ordinary functions of nature. Imbecility attaches to the whole frame,
            and renders it more or less powerless. Debility may be constitutional
            or may be the result or superinduced causes; Imbecility is always
            constitutional; infirmity is accidental, and results from sickness or
            a decay of the frame. These words, in their figurative uses, have the
            same distinctions; we speak of infirmity of will, debility of body,
            and an Imbecility which affects the whole man; but Imbecility is
            often used with specific reference to feebleness of mind.</p>

            <p>Syn.
             — Deceive, Delude, Mislead. Deceive is a general word applicable to
            any kind of misrepresentation affecting faith or life. To delude,
            primarily, is to make sport of, by deceiving, and is accomplished by
            playing upon one's imagination or credulity, as by exciting false
            hopes, causing him to undertake or expect what is impracticable, and
            making his failure ridiculous. It implies some infirmity of judgment
            in the victim, and intention to deceive in the deluder. But it is
            often used reflexively, indicating that a person's own weakness has
            made him the sport of others or of fortune; as, he deluded himself
            with a belief that luck would always favor him. To mislead is to
            lead, guide, or direct in a wrong way, either willfully or
            ignorantly.</p>

             — Deceiver, Impostor. A deceiver operates by stealth and in private

            assumption. The faithless friend and the fickle lover are deceivers;
            the false prophet and the pretended prince are impostors.</p>

            <p>Syn.
             — Deception, Deceit, Fraud, Imposition. Deception usually refers to
            the act, and deceit to the habit of the mind; hence we speak of a
            person as skilled in deception and addicted to deceit. The practice
            of deceit springs altogether from design, and that of the worst kind;
            but a deception does not always imply aim and intention. It may be
            undesigned or accidental. An imposition is an act of deception
            practiced upon some one to his annoyance or injury; a fraud implies
            the use of stratagem, with a view to some unlawful gain or advantage.</p>

             — Decided, Decisive. We call a thing decisive when it has the power
            or quality of deciding; as, a decisive battle; we speak of it as
            decided when it is so fully settled as to leave no room for doubt;
            as, a decided preference, a decided aversion. Hence, a decided
            victory is one about which there is no question; a decisive victory
            is one which ends the contest. Decisive is applied only to things;
            as, a decisive sentence, a decisive decree, a decisive judgment.
            Decided is applied equally to persons and things. Thus we speak of a
            man as decided in his whole of conduct; and as having a decided
            disgust, or a decided reluctance, to certain measures. "A politic
            caution, a guarded circumspection, were among the ruling principles
            of our forefathers in their most decided conduct." Burke. "The

            <p>Syn.
             — Decision, Determination, Resolution. Each of these words has two
            meanings, one implying the act of deciding, determining, or
            resolving; and the other a habit of mind as to doing. It is in the
            last sense that the words are here compared. Decision is a cutting
            short. It implies that several courses of action have been presented
            to the mind, and that the choice is now finally made. It supposes,
            therefore, a union of promptitude and energy. Determination is the
            natural consequence of decision. It is the settling of a thing with a
            fixed purpose to adhere. Resolution is the necessary result in a mind
            which is characterized by firmness. It is a spirit which scatters
            (resolves) all doubt, and is ready to face danger or suffering in
            carrying out one's determinations. Martin Luther was equally
            distinguished for his prompt decision, his steadfast determination,
            and his inflexible resolution.</p>

            <p>Syn.
             — Decline, Decay, Consumption. Decline marks the first stage in a
            downward progress; decay indicates the second stage, and denotes a
            tendency to ultimate destruction; consumption marks a steady decay
            from an internal exhaustion of strength. The health may experience a
            decline from various causes at any period of life; it is naturally
            subject to decay with the advance of old age; consumption may take
            place at almost any period of life, from disease which wears out the
            constitution. In popular language decline is often used as synonymous
            with consumption. By a gradual decline, states and communities lose
            their strength and vigor; by progressive decay, they are stripped of
            their honor, stability, and greatness; by a consumption of their
            resources and vital energy, they are led rapidly on to a completion
            of their existence.</p>

             — To Decry, Depreciate, Detract, Disparage. Decry and depreciate
            refer to the estimation of a thing, the former seeking to lower its
            value by clamorous censure, the latter by representing it as of
            little worth. Detract and disparage also refer to merit or value,
            which the former assails with caviling, insinuation, etc., while the
            latter willfully underrates and seeks to degrade it. Men decry their
            rivals and depreciate their measures. The envious detract from the
            merit of a good action, and disparage the motives of him who performs
            it.</p>

            <p>Syn.
             — Deference, Reverence, Respect. Deference marks an inclination to
            yield one's opinion, and to acquiesce in the sentiments of another in
            preference to one's own. Respect marks the estimation that we have
            for another, which makes us look to him as worthy of high confidence
            for the qualities of his mind and heart. Reverence denotes a mingling
            of fear with a high degree of respect and esteem. Age, rank, dignity,
            and personal merit call for deference; respect should be paid to the
            wise and good; reverence is due to God, to the authors of our being,
            and to the sanctity of the laws.</p>

             — Definition, Explanation, Description. A definition is designed to
            settle a thing in its compass and extent; an explanation is intended
            to remove some obscurity or misunderstanding, and is therefore more
            extended and minute; a description enters into striking particulars
            with a view to interest or impress by graphic effect. It is not
            therefore true, though often said, that description is only an
            extended definition. "Logicians distinguish definitions into
            essential and accidental. An essential definition states what are
            regarded as the constituent parts of the essence of that which is to
            be defined; and an accidental definition lays down what are regarded
            as circumstances belonging to it, viz., properties or accidents, such
            as causes, effects, etc." Whately.</p>

            from each other by one degree. This distance is not the same on
            different parts of a meridian, on account of the flattened figure of
            the earth, being 68.702 statute miles at the equator, and 69.396 at
            the poles.
             — Degree of longitude, the distance on a parallel of latitude

            One who delivers a package gives it forth; one who delivers a cargo
            discharges it; one who delivers a captive liberates him; one who

            <p>Syn.
             — Delusion, Illusion. These words both imply some deception
            practiced upon the mind. Delusion is deception from want of
            knowledge; illusion is deception from morbid imagination. An illusion
            is a false show, a mere cheat on the fancy or senses. It is, in other
            words, some idea or image presented to the bodily or mental vision
            which does not exist in reality. A delusion is a false judgment,
            usually affecting the real concerns of life. Or, in other words, it
            is an erroneous view of something which exists indeed, but has by no
            means the qualities or attributes ascribed to it. Thus we speak of
            the illusions of fancy, the illusions of hope, illusive prospects,
            illusive appearances, etc. In like manner, we speak of the delusions
            of stockjobbing, the delusions of honorable men, delusive appearances
            in trade, of being deluded by a seeming excellence. "A fanatic,
            either religious or political, is the subject of strong delusions;
            while the term illusion is applied solely to the visions of an
            uncontrolled imagination, the chimerical ideas of one blinded by
            hope, passion, or credulity, or lastly, to spectral and other ocular
            deceptions, to which the word delusion is never applied." Whately.</p>

            dependent.</p>

             — To Deplore, Mourn, Lament, Bewail, Bemoan. Mourn is the generic
            term, denoting a state of grief or sadness. To lament is to express
            grief by outcries, and denotes an earnest and strong expression of
            sorrow. To deplore marks a deeper and more prolonged emotion. To
            bewail and to bemoan are appropriate only to cases of poignant
            distress, in which the grief finds utterance either in wailing or in
            moans and sobs. A man laments his errors, and deplores the ruin they
            have brought on his family; mothers bewail or bemoan the loss of

            <p>Syn.
             — Corruption; vitiation; wickedness; vice; contamination;
            degeneracy.
             — Depravity, Depravation, Corruption. Depravilty is a vitiated
            state of mind or feeling; as, the depravity of the human heart;
            depravity of public morals. Depravation points to the act or process
            of making depraved, and hence to the end thus reached; as, a gradual
            depravation of principle; a depravation of manners, of the heart,
            etc. Corruption is the only one of these words which applies to
            physical substances, and in reference to these denotes the process by
            which their component parts are dissolved. Hence, when figuratively
            used, it denotes an utter vitiation of principle or feeling.
            Depravity applies only to the mind and heart: we can speak of a
            depraved taste, or a corrupt taste; in the first we introduce the
            notion that there has been the influence of bad training to pervert;
            in the second, that there is a want of true principle to pervert; in
            the second, that there is a want of true principles to decide. The
            other two words have a wider use: we can speak of the depravation or
            the corruption of taste and public sentiment. Depravity is more or
            less open; corruption is more or less disguised in its operations.
            What is depraved requires to be reformed; what is corrupt requires to
            be purified.</p>

             — Design, Intention, Purpose. Design has reference to something

             — Contrivance; invention; design; scheme; project; stratagem;
            shift.
             — Device, Contrivance. Device implies more of inventive power, and
            contrivance more of skill and dexterity in execution. A device
            usually has reference to something worked out for exhibition or show;
            a contrivance usually respects the arrangement or disposition of
            things with reference to securing some end. Devices were worn by
            knights-errant on their shields; contrivances are generally used to
            promote the practical convenience of life. The word device is often
            used in a bad sense; as, a crafty device; contrivance is almost
            always used in a good sense; as, a useful contrivance.</p>

            called from turning the plane of polarization to the right),
            occurring in many ripe fruits. Dextrose and levulose are obtained by
            the inversion of cane sugar or sucrose, and hence called invert
            sugar. Dextrose is chiefly obtained by the action of heat and acids
            on starch, and hence called also starch sugar. It is also formed from

            De Quincey.</p>
            <p>Syn.
             — Diction, Style, Phraseology. Style relates both to language and
            thought; diction, to language only; phraseology, to the mechanical
            structure of sentences, or the mode in which they are phrased. The
            style of Burke was enriched with all the higher graces of
            composition; his diction was varied and copious; his phraseology, at
            times, was careless and cumbersome. "Diction is a general term
            applicable alike to a single sentence or a connected composition.
            Errors in grammar, false construction, a confused disposition of
            words, or an improper application of them, constitute bad diction;
            but the niceties, the elegancies, the peculiarities, and the beauties
            of composition, which mark the genius and talent of the writer, are
            what is comprehended under the name of style." Crabb.</p>

            <p>Note: The following are instances of the dilemma. A young rhetorician
            applied to an old sophist to be taught the art of pleading, and
            bargained for a certain reward to be paid when he should gain a
            cause. The master sued for his reward, and the scholar endeavored to
            dilemma. "If I gain my cause, I shall withhold your pay, because the
            judge's award will be against you; if I lose it, I may withhold it,
            because I shall not yet have gained a cause." "On the contrary," says
            the master, "if you gain your cause, you must pay me, because you are
            to pay me when you gain a cause; if you lose it, you must pay me,
            because the judge will award it." Johnson.</p>

             — Attention; industry; assiduity; sedulousness; earnestness;
            constancy; heed; heedfulness; care; caution.
             — Diligence, Industry. Industry has the wider sense of the two,
            implying an habitual devotion to labor for some valuable end, as
            knowledge, property, etc. Diligence denotes earnest application to
            some specific object or pursuit, which more or less directly has a
            strong hold on one's interests or feelings. A man may be diligent for
            a time, or in seeking some favorite end, without meriting the title
            of industrious. Such was the case with Fox, while Burke was eminent
            not only for diligence, but industry; he was always at work, and
            always looking out for some new field of mental effort.
            The sweat of industry would dry and die, But for the end it works to.

            Di*rec"tion, n. Etym: [L. directio: cf. F. direction.]

            guidance; management; superintendence; administration; as, the
            direction o.

            All nature is but art, unknown to thee;direction, which thou canst

            <p>Syn.
             — Administration; guidance; management; superintendence; oversight;
            government; order; command; guide; clew. Direction, Control, Command,
            Order. These words, as here compared, have reference to the exercise
            of power over the actions of others. Control is negative, denoting
            power to restrain; command is positive, implying a right to enforce
            obedience; directions are commands containing instructions how to
            act. Order conveys more prominently the idea of authority than the
            word direction. A shipmaster has the command of his vessel; he gives
            orders or directions to the seamen as to the mode of sailing it; and
            exercises a due control over the passengers.</p>

            <p>DIRECTLY<br>

            </p>

            <p>8. Immediately after; as soon as.
            Directly he stopped, the coffin was removed. Dickens.</p>
            <p>Note: This use of the word is common in England, especially in
            colloquial speech, but it can hardly be regarded as a well-sanctioned
            or desirable use. Directly proportional (Math.), proportional in the
            order of the terms; increasing or decreasing together, and with a

            implies, without any interposition of other occupation; instantly
            implies, without any intervention of time. Hence, "I will do it
            directly," means, "I will go straightway about it." "I will do it
            immediately," means, "I will do it as the very next thing." "I will
            do it instantly," allows not a particle of delay. Instantaneously,
            like instantly, marks an interval too small to be appreciable, but
            commonly relates to physical causes; as, the powder touched by fire
            instantaneously exploded.</p>

            Dis- (; 258)
            </p>
            <p>Defn: .</p>
            <p>1. A prefix from the Latin, whence F. dés, or sometimes dé-, dis-.
            The Latin dis- appears as di- before b, d, g, l, m, n, r, v, becomes
            dif- before f, and either dis- or di- before j. It is from the same
            root as bis twice, and duo, E. two. See Two, and cf. Bi-, Di-, Dia-.
            Dis- denotes separation, a parting from, as in distribute,
            disconnect; hence it often has the force of a privative and negative,
            as in disarm, disoblige, disagree. Also intensive, as in dissever.</p>
            <p>Note: Walker's rule of pronouncing this prefix is, that the s ought
            always to be pronounced like z, when the next syllable is accented
            and begins with "a flat mute [b, d, v, g, z], a liquid [l, m, n, r],
            or a vowel; as, disable, disease, disorder, disuse, disband, disdain,
            disgrace, disvalue, disjoin, dislike, dislodge, dismay, dismember,
            dismiss, dismount, disnatured, disrank, disrelish, disrobe." Dr.
            Webster's example in disapproving of Walker's rule and pronouncing
            dis- as diz in only one (disease) of the above words, is followed by
            recent orthoëpists. See Disable, Disgrace, and the other words,
            beginning with dis-, in this Dictionary.</p>
            <p>2. A prefix from Gr. Di-.</p>

            refuse to accept a trust or employment on account of some disability
            prevents him from entering into such engagements.</p>

            type of disappearing carriage in the coast artillery of the United
            States army is the Buffington-Crozier carriage, in which the gun
            trunnions are secured at the upper and after ends of a pair of heavy

            inclined chassis rails. The counterweight is held in place by a pawl

            counterweight sinks, raising the gun to the firing position above the
            parapet. The recoil following the discharge returns the gun to the

            Our belief or disbelief of a thing does not alter the nature of the
            thing. Tillotson.
            No sadder proof can be given by a man of his own littleness that
            disbelief in great men. Carlyle.</p>
            <p>Syn.
             — Distrust; unbelief; incredulity; doubt; skepticism.
             — Disbelief, Unbelief. Unbelief is a mere failure to admit;
            disbelief is a positive rejection. One may be an unbeliever in
            Christianity from ignorance or want of inquiry; a unbeliever has the
            proofs before him, and incurs the guilt of setting them aside.
            Unbelief is usually open to conviction; disbelief is already
            convinced as to the falsity of that which it rejects. Men often tell
            a story in such a manner that we regard everything they say with
            unbelief. Familiarity with the worst parts of human nature often
            leads us into a disbelief in many good qualities which really exist
            among men.</p>

            be true or actual.
            Assertions for which there is abundant positive evidence are often
            disbelieved, on account of what is called their improbability or

            Distemper is now used by physicians only of the diseases of animals.
            Malady is not a medical term, and is less used than formerly in
            literature. Affection has special reference to the part, organ, or
            function disturbed; as, his disease is an affection of the lungs. A
            disease is usually deep-seated and permanent, or at least prolonged;
            a disorder is often slight, partial, and temporary; malady has less
            of a technical sense than the other terms, and refers more especially
            to the suffering endured. In a figurative sense we speak of a disease
            mind, of disordered faculties, and of mental maladies.</p>

             — Dislike, Aversion, Reluctance, Repugnance, Disgust, Antipathy.
            Dislike is the more general term, applicable to both persons and
            things and arising either from feeling or judgment. It may mean
            little more than want of positive liking; but antipathy, repugnance,
            disgust, and aversion are more intense phases of dislike. Aversion
            denotes a fixed and habitual dislike; as, an aversion to or for
            business. Reluctance and repugnance denote a mental strife or
            hostility something proposed (repugnance being the stronger); as, a
            reluctance to make the necessary sacrifices, and a repugnance to the
            submission required. Disgust is repugnance either of taste or moral
            feeling; as, a disgust at gross exhibitions of selfishness. Antipathy
            is primarily an instinctive feeling of dislike of a thing, such as
            most persons feel for a snake. When used figuratively, it denotes a
            correspondent dislike for certain persons, modes of acting, etc. Men
            have an aversion to what breaks in upon their habits; a reluctance
            and repugnance to what crosses their will; a disgust at what offends
            their sensibilities; and are often governed by antipathies for which
            they can give no good reason.</p>

            <p>Defn: To cash or to advance money for, as a bill or note.</p>
            <p>Note: (a) Do and did are much employed as auxiliaries, the verb to
            which they are joined being an infinitive. As an auxiliary the verb
            do has no participle. "I do set my bow in the cloud." Gen. ix. 13.
            [Now archaic or rare except for emphatic assertion.]
            Rarely . . . did the wrongs of individuals to the knowledge of the
            public. Macaulay.
            (b) They are often used in emphatic construction. "You don't say so,
            Mr. Jobson.
             — but I do say so." Sir W. Scott. "I did love him, but scorn him
            now." Latham. (c) In negative and interrogative constructions, do and
            did are in common use. I do not wish to see them; what do you think
            Did Cæsar cross the Tiber He did not. "Do you love me" Shak. (d) Do,
            as an auxiliary, is supposed to have been first used before
            imperatives. It expresses entreaty or earnest request; as, do help
            me. In the imperative mood, but not in the indicative, it may be used
            with the verb to be; as, do be quiet. Do, did, and done often stand
            as a general substitute or representative verb, and thus save the
            repetition of the principal verb. "To live and die is all we have to
            do." Denham. In the case of do and did as auxiliaries, the sense may
            be completed by the infinitive (without to) of the verb represented.
            "When beauty lived and died as flowers do now." Shak. "I . . . chose
            my wife as she did her wedding gown." Goldsmith.
            My brightest hopes giving dark fears a being. As the light does the
            shadow. Longfellow.
            In unemphatic affirmative sentences do is, for the most part, archaic
            or poetical; as, "This just reproach their virtue does excite."
            Dryden. To do one's best, To do one's diligence (and the like), to
            exert one's self; to put forth one's best or most or most diligent
            efforts. "We will . . . do our best to gain their assent." Jowett
            (Thucyd.).
             — To do one's business, to ruin one. [Colloq.] Wycherley.

             — To do with, to dispose of; to make use of; to employ; — usually
            preceded by what. "Men are many times brought to that extremity, that
            were it not for God they would not know what to do with themselves."
            Tillotson.
             — To have to do with, to have concern, business or intercourse
            with; to deal with. When preceded by what, the notion is usually
            implied that the affair does not concern the person denoted by the
            subject of have. "Philology has to do with language in its fullest
            sense." Earle. "What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah 2 Sam.

            <p>Defn: A period of from four to six weeks, in the summer, variously

            rising in ancient times of the Dog Star (Sirius) with the sun.
            Popularly, the sultry, close part of the summer.</p>
            <p>Note: The conjunction of the rising of the Dog Star with the rising
            of the sun was regarded by the ancients as one of the causes of the
            sultry heat of summer, and of the maladies which then prevailed. But
            as the conjunction does not occur at the same time in all latitudes,
            and is not constant in the same region for a long period, there has
            been much variation in calendars regarding the limits of the dog
            days. The astronomer Roger Long states that in an ancient calendar in
            Bede (died 735) the beginning of dog days is placed on the 14th of
            July; that in a calendar prefixed to the Common Prayer, printed in
            the time of Queen Elizabeth, they were said to begin on the 6th of
            July and end on the 5th of September; that, from the Restoration
            (1660) to the beginning of New Style (1752), British almanacs placed
            the beginning on the 19th of July and the end on the 28th of August;
            and that after 1752 the beginning was put on the 30th of July, the
            end on the 7th of September. Some English calendars now put the
            beginning on July 3d, and the ending on August 11th. A popular
            American almanac of the present time (1890) places the beginning on
            the 25th of July, and the end on the 5th of September.</p>

             — tenet; opinion; proposition; doctrine.
             — Dogma, Tenet. A tenet is that which is maintained as true with
            great firmness; as, the tenets of our holy religion. A dogma is that
            which is laid down with authority as indubitably true, especially a
            religious doctrine; as, the dogmas of the church. A tenet rests on
            its own intrinsic merits or demerits; a dogma rests on authority
            regarded as competent to decide and determine. Dogma has in our
            language acquired, to some extent, a repulsive sense, from its
            carrying with it the idea of undue authority or assumption. this is
            more fully the case with its derivatives dogmatical and dogmatism.</p>

            fall, and that second object causes a third to fall, etc.; the

            edge and therefore easily knocked over; when the first is made to
            fall against the next, it starts a sequence which ends when all have

            Communism. The apparent assumption was that an Asian country with a
            Western orientation was as politically unstable as a domino standing
            on edge. Used by some as a justification for American involvement in
            the Vietnam war, 1964-1972.</p>

            advance, or to extend in length, and usually expresses an action as
            gradual or continuous, and leisurely. We pour liquid quickly, but we
            draw it in a continued stream. We force compliance by threats, but we
            draw it by gradual prevalence. We may write a letter with haste, but

            draw a bar of metal by continued beating. To draw a bow, to bend the

             — To Draw, Drag. Draw differs from drag in this, that drag implies
            a natural inaptitude for drawing, or positive resistance; it is
            applied to things pulled or hauled along the ground, or moved with
            toil or difficulty. Draw is applied to all bodies moved by force in
            advance, whatever may be the degree of force; it commonly implies
            that some kind of aptitude or provision exists for drawing. Draw is
            the more general or generic term, and drag the more specific. We say,
            the horses draw a coach or wagon, but they drag it through mire; yet
            draw is properly used in both cases.</p>
