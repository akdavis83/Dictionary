             — Deception; deceit; mistake.
             — Fallacy, Sophistry. A fallacy is an argument which professes to
            be decisive, but in reality is not; sophistry is also false
            reasoning, but of so specious and subtle a kind as to render it
            difficult to expose its fallacy. Many fallacies are obvious, but the
            evil of sophistry lies in its consummate art. "Men are apt to suffer
            their minds to be misled by fallacies which gratify their passions.
            Many persons have obscured and confounded the nature of things by
            their wretched sophistry; though an act be never so sinful, they will
            strip it of its guilt." South.</p>

            plants. See Adipose tissue, under Adipose.</p>
            <p>Note: Animal fats are composed mainly of three distinct fats,
            tristearin, tripalmitin, and triolein, mixed in varying proportions.
            As olein is liquid at ordinary temperatures, while the other two fats
            are solid, it follows that the consistency or hardness of fats
            depends upon the relative proportion of the three individual fats.
            During the life of an animal, the fat is mainly in a liquid state in
            the fat cells, owing to the solubility of the two solid fats in the
            more liquid olein at the body temperature. Chemically, fats are
            composed of fatty acid, as stearic, palmitic, oleic, etc., united
            with glyceryl. In butter fat, olein and palmitin predominate, mixed
            with another fat characteristic of butter, butyrin. In the vegetable
            kingdom many other fats or glycerides are to be found, as myristin
            from nutmegs, a glyceride of lauric acid in the fat of the bay tree,
            etc.</p>

            certain fatlike substance of artificial production, as paraffin. Most

            acids.</p>

            distaff, a second as spinning, and the third as cutting off the
            thread.</p>
            <p>Note: Among all nations it has been common to speak of fate or
            destiny as a power superior to gods and men — swaying all things
            irresistibly. This may be called the fate of poets and mythologists.
            Philosophical fate is the sum of the laws of the universe, the
            product of eternal intelligence and the blind properties of matter.
            Theological fate represents Deity as above the laws of nature, and
            ordaining all things according to his will — the expression of that
            will being the law. Krauth-Fleming.</p>

            a failing; a defect; a blemish.

            <p>Syn.
             — — Error; blemish; defect; imperfection; weakness; blunder;
            failing; vice.
             — Fault, Failing, Defect, Foible. A fault is positive, something
            morally wrong; a failing is negative, some weakness or failling short
            in a man's character, disposition, or habits; a defect is also
            negative, and as applied to character is the absence of anyything
            which is necessary to its completeness or perfection; a foible is a
            less important weakness, which we overlook or smile at. A man may
            have many failings, and yet commit but few faults; or his faults and
            failings may be few, while his foibles are obvious to all. The faults
            of a friend are often palliated or explained away into mere defects,
            and the defects or foibles of an enemy exaggerated into faults. "I
            have failings in common with every human being, besides my own
            peculiar faults; but of avarice I have generally held myself
            guiltless." Fox. "Presumption and self-applause are the foibles of
            mankind." Waterland.</p>

            soil, also the mineral kaolin, an essential material in the making of
            fine pottery. Common feldspar is itself largely used for the same
            purpose.</p>

            <p>Defn: An act on the part of the vassal which cost him his fee by
            forfeiture. Burrill.</p>
            <p>2. (O.Eng.Law)</p>
            <p>Defn: An offense which occasions a total forfeiture either lands or
            goods, or both, at the common law, and to which capital or other
            punishment may be added, according to the degree of guilt.</p>
            <p>3. A heinous crime; especially, a crime punishable by death or
            imprisonment.</p>
            <p>Note: Forfeiture for crime having been generally abolished in the
            United States, the term felony, in American law, has lost this point
            of distinction; and its meaning, where not fixed by statute, is
            somewhat vague and undefined; generally, however, it is used to
            denote an offense of a high grade, punishable either capitally or by
            a term of imprisonment. In Massachusetts, by statute, any crime
            punishable by death or imprisonment in the state prison, and no
            other, is a felony; so in New York. the tendency now is to obliterate
            the distinction between felonies and misdemeanors; and this has been
            done partially in England, and completely in some of the States of
            the Union. The distinction is purely arbitrary, and its entire
            abolition is only a question of time.</p>
            <p>Note: There is no lawyer who would undertake to tell what a felony
            is, otherwise than by enumerating the various kinds of offenses which
            are so called. originally, the word felony had a meaning: it denoted
            all offenses the penalty of which included forfeiture of goods; but
            subsequent acts of Parliament have declared various offenses to be
            felonies, without enjoining that penalty, and have taken away the
            penalty from others, which continue, nevertheless, to be called
            felonies, insomuch that the acts so called have now no property
            whatever in common, save that of being unlawful and purnishable. J.

            <p>Note: Ferments are of two kinds: (a) Formed or organized ferments.
            (b) Unorganized or structureless ferments. The latter are also called
            soluble or chemical ferments, and enzymes. Ferments of the first
            class are as a rule simple microscopic vegetable organisms, and the
            fermentations which they engender are due to their growth and
            development; as, the acetic ferment, the butyric ferment, etc. See
            Fermentation. Ferments of the second class, on the other hand, are
            chemical substances, as a rule soluble in glycerin and precipitated
            by alcohol. In action they are catalytic and, mainly, hydrolytic.
            Good examples are pepsin of the dastric juice, ptyalin of the salvia,
            and disease of malt. globular proteins, capable of catalyzing a wide
            variety of chemical reactions, not merely hydrolytic. The full set of
            enzymes causing production of ethyl alcohol from sugar has been
            identified and individually purified and studied. See enzyme</p>

            <p>1. The process of undergoing an effervescent change, as by the action
            of yeast; in a wider sense (Physiol. Chem.), the transformation of an
            organic substance into new compounds by the action of a ferment,
            either formed or unorganized. It differs in kind according to the
            nature of the ferment which causes it.</p>
            <p>2. A state of agitation or excitement, as of the intellect or the
            feelings.
            It puts the soul to fermentation and activity. Jer. Taylor.
            A univesal fermentation of human thought and faith. C. Kingsley.
            Acetous, or Acetic, fermentation, a form of oxidation in which
            alcohol is converted into vinegar or acetic acid by the agency of a
            specific fungus or ferment (Mycoderma aceti). The process involves
            two distinct reactions, in which the oxygen of the air is essential.
            An intermediate product, aldehyde, is formed in the first process. 1.
            C2H6O + O = H2O + C2H4O</p>
            <p>Note: Alcohol. Water. Aldehyde. 2. C2H4O + O = C2H4O2</p>
            <p>Note: Aldehyde. Acetic acid.
             — Alcoholic fermentation, the fermentation which saccharine bodies
            undergo when brought in contact with the yeast plant or Torula. The
            sugar is converted, either directly or indirectly, into alcohol and
            carbonic acid, the rate of action being dependent on the rapidity
            with which the Torulæ develop.
             — Ammoniacal fermentation, the conversion of the urea of the urine
            into ammonium carbonate, through the growth of the special urea
            ferment. CON2H4 + 2H2O = (NH4)2CO3</p>
            <p>Note: Urea. Water. Ammonium carbonate.</p>
            <p>Note: Whenever urine is exposed to the air in open vessels for
            several days it undergoes this alkaline fermentation.
             — Butyric fermentation, the decomposition of various forms of
            organic matter, through the agency of a peculiar worm-shaped vibrio,
            with formation of more or less butyric acid. It is one of the many
            forms of fermentation that collectively constitute putrefaction. See
            Lactic fermentation.
             — Fermentation by an unorganized ferment or enzyme. Fermentations
            of this class are purely chemical reactions, in which the ferment
            acts as a simple catalytic agent. Of this nature are the
            decomposition or inversion of cane sugar into levulose and dextrose
            by boiling with dilute acids, the conversion of starch into dextrin
            and sugar by similar treatment, the conversion of starch into like
            products by the action of diastase of malt or ptyalin of saliva, the
            conversion of albuminous food into peptones and other like products
            by the action of pepsin-hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice or by
            the ferment of the pancreatic juice.
             — Fermentation theory of disease (Biol. &amp; Med.), the theory that
            most if not all, infectious or zymotic disease are caused by the
            introduction into the organism of the living germs of ferments, or
            ferments already developed (organized ferments), by which processes
            of fermentation are set up injurious to health. See Germ theory.
             — Glycerin fermentation, the fermentation which occurs on mixing a
            dilute solution of glycerin with a peculiar species of schizomycetes
            and some carbonate of lime, and other matter favorable to the growth
            of the plant, the glycerin being changed into butyric acid, caproic
            acid, butyl, and ethyl alcohol. With another form of bacterium
            (Bacillus subtilis) ethyl alcohol and butyric acid are mainly formed.
             — Lactic fermentation, the transformation of milk sugar or other
            saccharine body into lactic acid, as in the souring of milk, through
            the agency of a special bacterium (Bacterium lactis of Lister). In
            this change the milk sugar, before assuming the form of lactic acid,
            presumably passes through the stage of glucose. C12H22O11.H2O =
            4C3H6O3</p>
            <p>Note: Hydrated milk sugar. Lactic acid.</p>
            <p>Note: In the lactic fermentation of dextrose or glucose, the lactic
            acid which is formed is very prone to undergo butyric fermentation
            after the manner indicated in the following equation: 2C3H6O3 (lactic
            acid) = C4H8O2 (butyric acid) + 2CO2 (carbonic acid) + 2H2 (hydrogen
            gas).

             — Fervor, Ardor. Fervor is a boiling heat, and ardor is a burning
            heat. Hence, in metaphor, we commonly use fervor and its derivatives
            when we conceive of thoughts or emotions under the image of
            ebullition, or as pouring themselves forth. Thus we speak of the
            fervor of passion, fervid declamation, fervid importunity, fervent
            supplication, fervent desires, etc. Ardent is used when we think of
            anything as springing from a deepseated glow of soul; as, ardent
            friendship, ardent zeal, ardent devotedness; burning with ardor for
            the fight.</p>

            as strong as beautiful, in reference to the single attribute implied
            in the latter term; but when we speak of a fine woman, we include a
            greater variety of particulars, viz., all the qualities which become
            a woman, — breeding, sentiment, tact, etc. The term is equally
            comprehensive when we speak of a fine garden, landscape, horse, poem,
            etc.; and, though applied to a great variety of objects, the word has
            still a very definite sense, denoting a high degree of characteristic

             — Finical, Spruce, Foppish. These words are applied to persons who
            are studiously desirous to cultivate finery of appearance. One who is
            spruce is elaborately nice in dress; one who is finical shows his
            affectation in language and manner as well as in dress; one who is
            foppish distinguishes himself by going to the extreme of the fashion
            in the cut of his clothes, by the tawdriness of his ornaments, and by
            the ostentation of his manner. "A finical gentleman clips his words
            and screws his body into as small a compass as possible, to give
            himself the air of a delicate person; a spruce gentleman strives not
            to have a fold wrong in his frill or cravat, nor a hair of his head
            to lie amiss; a foppish gentleman seeks . . . to render himself
            distinguished for finery." Crabb.

             — Flash, Glitter, Gleam, Glisten, Glister. Flash differs from
            glitter and gleam, denoting a flood or wide extent of light. The
            latter words may express the issuing of light from a small object, or
            from a pencil of rays. Flash differs from other words, also, in
            denoting suddenness of appearance and disappearance. Flashing differs
            from exploding or disploding in not being accompanied with a loud
            report. To glisten, or glister, is to shine with a soft and fitful
            luster, as eyes suffused with tears, or flowers wet with dew.</p>

            of the organs of reproduction, whether inclosed by a circle of foliar
            parts or not. A complete flower consists of two essential parts, the
            stamens and the pistil, and two floral envelopes, the corolla and
            callyx. In mosses the flowers consist of a few special leaves
            surrounding or subtending organs called archegonia. See Blossom, and
            Corolla.</p>
            <p>Note: If we examine a common flower, such for instance as a geranium,

            sometimes tubular, sometimes consisting of separate leaves called
            sepals; secondly, an inner envelope or corolla, which is generally
            more or less colored, and which, like the calyx, is sometimes
            tubular, sometimes composed of separate leaves called petals;
            thirdly, one or more stamens, consisting of a stalk or filament and a
            head or anther, in which the pollen is produced; and fourthly, a
            pistil, which is situated in the center of the flower, and consists
            generally of three principal parts; one or more compartments at the
            base, each containing one or more seeds; the stalk or style; and the
            stigma, which in many familiar instances forms a small head, at the
            top of the style or ovary, and to which the pollen must find its way
            in order to fertilize the flower. Sir J. Lubbock.</p>

             — Fluctuate is applied both to things and persons and denotes that
            they move as they are acted upon. The stocks fluctuate; a man
            fluctuates. between conflicting influences. Vacillate and waver are

            vacillates when he goes backward and forward in his opinions and
            purposes, without any fixity of mind or principles. A man wavers when
            he shrinks back or hesitates at the approach of difficulty or danger.
            One who is fluctuating in his feelings is usually vacillating in
            resolve, and wavering in execution.</p>

            avoirdupois, or 455.6 grains. (b) In England, a measure of capacity
            equal to the twentieth part of an imperial pint. For water, this is
            the weight of the avoirdupois ounce, or 437.5 grains.

            important fluids of the body. The tissues themselves contain a large
            amount of combined water, so much, that an entire human body dried in
            vacuo with a very moderate degree of heat gives about 66 per cent of
            water.

            from the mass of the material, as when green crystals of fluor spar
            afford blue reflections. It is due not to the difference in the color
            of a distinct surface layer, but to the power which the substance has
            of modifying the light incident upon it. The light emitted by
            fluorescent substances is in general of lower refrangibility than the
            incident light. Stockes.</p>

            and silicon especially, that it can neither be prepared nor kept in
            glass vessels. If set free it immediately attacks the containing
            material, so that it was not isolated until 1886. It is a pungent,
            corrosive, colorless gas. Symbol F. Atomic weight 19.</p>
            <p>Note: Fluorine unites with hydrogen to form hydrofluoric acid, which

            fireplace; perh. akin to E. bake. Cf. Curfew, Fuel, Fusil the
            firearm.]</p>
            <p>1. (Opt.)</p>
            <p>Defn: A point in which the rays of light meet, after being reflected
            or refrcted, and at which the image is formed; as, the focus of a
            lens or mirror.</p>
            <p>2. (Geom.)</p>
            <p>Defn: A point so related to a conic section and certain straight line
            called the directrix that the ratio of the distace between any point
            of the curve and the focus to the distance of the same point from the
            directrix is constant.</p>
            <p>Note: Thus, in the ellipse FGHKLM, A is the focus and CD the
            directrix, when the ratios FA:FE, GA:GD, MA:MC, etc., are all equal.
            So in the hyperbola, A is the focus and CD the directrix when the
            ratio HA:HK is constant for all points of the curve; and in the
            parabola, A is the focus and CD the directrix when the ratio BA:BC is
            constant. In the ellipse this ratio is less than unity, in the
            parabola equal to unity, and in the hyperbola greater than unity. The
            ellipse and hyperbola have each two foci, and two corresponding
            directrixes, and the parabola has one focus and one directrix. In the
            ellipse the sum of the two lines from any point of the curve to the
            two foci is constant; that is: AG+GB=AH+HB; and in the hyperbola the
            difference of the corresponding lines is constant. The diameter which
            passes through the foci of the ellipse is the major axis. The
            diameter which being produced passes through the foci of the
            hyperbola is the transverse axis. The middle point of the major or
            the transverse axis is the center of the curve. Certain other curves,
            as the lemniscate and the Cartesian ovals, have points called foci,
            possessing properties similar to those of the foci of conic sections.
            In an ellipse, rays of light coming from one focus, and reflected
            from the curve, proceed in lines directed toward the other; in an
            hyperbola, in lines directed from the other; in a parabola, rays from
            the focus, after reflection at the curve, proceed in lines parallel
            to the axis. Thus rays from A in the ellipse are reflected to B; rays
            from A in the hyperbola are reflected toward L and M away from B.</p>
            <p>3. A central point; a point of concentration. Aplanatic focus. (Opt.)
            See under Aplanatic.
             — Conjugate focus (Opt.), the focus for rays which have a sensible
            divergence, as from a near object; — so called because the positions

            <p>Note: Foods are divided into two main groups: nitrogenous, or
            proteid, foods, i.e., those which contain nitrogen, and
            nonnitrogenous, i.e., those which do not contain nitrogen. The latter
            group embraces the fats and carbohydrates, which collectively are
            sometimes termed heat producers or respiratory foods, since by
            oxidation in the body they especially subserve the production of
            heat. The proteids, on the other hand, are known as plastic foods or
            tissue formers, since no tissue can be formed without them. These
            latter terms, however, are misleading, since proteid foods may also
            give rise to heat both directly and indirectly, and the fats and
            carbohydrates are useful in other ways than in producing heat.</p>

             — Force, Strength. Strength looks rather to power as an inward
            capability or energy. Thus we speak of the strength of timber, bodily
            strength, mental strength, strength of emotion, etc. Force, on the
            other hand, looks more to the outward; as, the force of gravitation,
            force of circumstances, force of habit, etc. We do, indeed, speak of
            strength of will and force of will; but even here the former may lean
            toward the internal tenacity of purpose, and the latter toward the
            outward expression of it in action. But, though the two words do in a
            few cases touch thus closely on each other, there is, on the whole, a
            marked distinction in our use of force and strength. "Force is the
            name given, in mechanical science, to whatever produces, or can
            produce, motion." Nichol.
            Thy tears are of no force to mollify This flinty man. Heywood.

            thrust forcibly into the corresponding hollow cone b on the other
            shaft, compels the shafts to rotate together, by the hold the
            friction of the conical surfaces gives. (b) A toothed clutch, one
            member of which, instead of being made fast on its shaft, is held by
            friction and can turn, by slipping, under excessive strain or in
            starting.

            vessels intermediate between corvettes and ships of the line.
            Frigates, from about 1750 to 1850, had one full battery deck and,
            often, a spar deck with a lighter battery. They carried sometimes as
            many as fifty guns. After the application of steam to navigation
            steam frigates of largely increased size and power were built, and
            formed the main part of the navies of the world till about 1870, when

            are remarkable for their long wings and powerful flight. Their food
            consists of fish which they obtain by robbing gulls, terns, and other
            birds, of their prey. They are related to the pelicans.

            <p>5. (Math.)</p>
            <p>Defn: A quantity so connected with another quantity, that if any
            alteration be made in the latter there will be a consequent
            alteration in the former. Each quantity is said to be a function of
            the other. Thus, the circumference of a circle is a function of the
            diameter. If x be a symbol to which different numerical values can be
            assigned, such expressions as x2, 3x, Log. x, and Sin. x, are all
            functions of x. Algebraic function, a quantity whose connection with
            the variable is expressed by an equation that involves only the
            algebraic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication,
            division, raising to a given power, and extracting a given root; —
            opposed to transcendental function.
             — Arbitrary function. See under Arbitrary.
             — Calculus of functions. See under Calculus.
             — Carnot's function (Thermo-dynamics), a relation between the
            amount of heat given off by a source of heat, and the work which can
            be done by it. It is approximately equal to the mechanical equivalent
            of the thermal unit divided by the number expressing the temperature
            in degrees of the air thermometer, reckoned from its zero of
            expansion.
             — Circular functions. See Inverse trigonometrical functions
            (below).
             — Continuous function, a quantity that has no interruption in the
            continuity of its real values, as the variable changes between any
            specified limits.
             — Discontinuous function. See under Discontinuous.
             — Elliptic functions, a large and important class of functions, so
            called because one of the forms expresses the relation of the arc of
            an ellipse to the straight lines connected therewith.
             — Explicit function, a quantity directly expressed in terms of the
            independently varying quantity; thus, in the equations y = 6x2, y =
            10 -x3, the quantity y is an explicit function of x.
             — Implicit function, a quantity whose relation to the variable is
            expressed indirectly by an equation; thus, y in the equation x2 + y2
            = 100 is an implicit function of x.
             — Inverse trigonometrical functions, or Circular function, the
            lengths of arcs relative to the sines, tangents, etc. Thus, AB is the
            arc whose sine is BD, and (if the length of BD is x) is written sin -
            1x, and so of the other lines. See Trigonometrical function (below).
            Other transcendental functions are the exponential functions, the
            elliptic functions, the gamma functions, the theta functions, etc.
             — One-valued function, a quantity that has one, and only one, value
            for each value of the variable.
             — Transcendental functions, a quantity whose connection with the
            variable cannot be expressed by algebraic operations; thus, y in the
            equation y = 10x is a transcendental function of x. See Algebraic
            function (above).
             — Trigonometrical function, a quantity whose relation to the
            variable is the same as that of a certain straight line drawn in a
            circle whose radius is unity, to the length of a corresponding are of
            the circle. Let AB be an arc in a circle, whose radius OA is unity
            let AC be a quadrant, and let OC, DB, and AF be drawnpependicular to
            OA, and EB and CG parallel to OA, and let OB be produced to G and F.
            E Then BD is the sine of the arc AB; OD or EB is the cosine, AF is
            the tangent, CG is the cotangent, OF is the secant OG is the
            cosecant, AD is the versed sine, and CE is the coversed sine of the
            are AB. If the length of AB be represented by x (OA being unity) then
            the lengths of Functions. these lines (OA being unity) are the
            trigonometrical functions of x, and are written sin x, cos x, tan x
            (or tang x), cot x, sec x, cosec x, versin x, coversin x. These
            quantities are also considered as functions of the angle BOA.</p>
