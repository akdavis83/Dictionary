            <h2><a id="chap02"></a>B</h2>
            <p>Defn: is the second letter of the English alphabet. (See Guide to
            Pronunciation, §§ 196,220.) It is etymologically related to p , v , f
            , w and m , letters representing sounds having a close organic
            affinity to its own sound; as in Eng. bursar and purser; Eng. bear
            and Lat. pear; Eng. silver and Ger. silber; Lat. cubitum and It.
            gomito; Eng. seven, Anglo-Saxon seofon, Ger. sieben, Lat. septem,
            Gr.ptan. The form of letter B is Roman, from Greek B (Beta), of
            Semitic origin. The small b was formed by gradual change from the
            capital B.</p>
            <p>Note: In Music, B is the nominal of the seventh tone in the model
            major scale (the scale of C major ), or of the second tone in it's
            relative minor scale (that of A minor ) . B stands for B flat, the
            tone a half step , or semitone, lower than B. In German, B stands for
            our B, while our B natural is called H (pronounced hä).</p>

             — To Banish, Exile, Expel. The idea of a coercive removal from a
            place is common to these terms. A man is banished when he is forced
            by the government of a country (be he a foreigner or a native) to
            leave its borders. A man is exiled when he is driven into banishment
            from his native country and home. Thus to exile is to banish, but to
            banish is not always to exile. To expel is to eject or banish,
            summarily or authoritatively, and usually under circumstances of
            disgrace; as, to expel from a college; expelled from decent society.</p>

            1643. It is made in its simplest form by filling a graduated glass
            tube about 34 inches long with mercury and inverting it in a cup
            containing mercury. The column of mercury in the tube descends until
            balanced by the weight of the atmosphere, and its rise or fall under
            varying conditions is a measure of the change in the atmospheric
            pressure. At the sea level its ordinary height is about 30 inches
            (760 millimeters). See Sympiesometer. Nichol. Aneroid barometer. See

            <p>Note: In the trough battery, copper and zinc plates, connected in
            pairs, divide the trough into cells, which are filled with an acid or
            oxidizing liquid; the effect is exhibited when wires connected with
            the two end-plates are brought together. In Daniell's battery, the
            metals are zinc and copper, the former in dilute sulphuric acid, or a
            solution of sulphate of zinc, the latter in a saturated solution of
            sulphate of copper. A modification of this is the common gravity
            battery, so called from the automatic action of the two fluids, which
            are separated by their specific gravities. In Grove's battery,
            platinum is the metal used with zinc; two fluids are used, one of
            them in a porous cell surrounded by the other. In Bunsen's or the
            carbon battery, the carbon of gas coke is substituted for the
            platinum of Grove's. In Leclanché's battery, the elements are zinc in
            a solution of ammonium chloride, and gas carbon surrounded with
            manganese dioxide in a porous cell. A secondary battery is a battery
            which usually has the two plates of the same kind, generally of lead,
            in dilute sulphuric acid, and which, when traversed by an electric
            current, becomes charged, and is then capable of giving a current of
            itself for a time, owing to chemical changes produced by the charging
            current. A storage battery is a kind of secondary battery used for
            accumulating and storing the energy of electrical charges or
            currents, usually by means of chemical work done by them; an
            accumulator.</p>
            <p>5. A number of similar machines or devices in position; an apparatus
            consisting of a set of similar parts; as, a battery of boilers, of

            <p>Syn.
             — Conflict; encounter; contest; action. Battle, Combat, Fight,
            Engagement. These words agree in denoting a close encounter between
            contending parties. Fight is a word of less dignity than the others.
            Except in poetry, it is more naturally applied to the encounter of a
            few individuals, and more commonly an accidental one; as, a street
            fight. A combat is a close encounter, whether between few or many,
            and is usually premeditated. A battle is commonly more general and
            prolonged. An engagement supposes large numbers on each side, engaged
            or intermingled in the conflict.</p>

            <p>BAUME<br>
            Bau`mé", a.
            </p>
            <p>Defn: Designating or conforming to either of the scales used by the
            French chemist Antoine Baumé in the graduation of his hydrometers; of
            or relating to Baumé's scales or hydrometers. There are two Baumé
            hydrometers. One, which is used with liquids heavier than water,
            sinks to 0º in pure water, and to 15º in a 15 per cent salt solution;
            the other, for liquids lighter than water, sinks to 0º in a 10 per
            cent salt solution and to 10º in pure water. In both cases the
            graduation, based on the distance between these fundamental points,
            is continued along the stem as far as desired. Since all the degrees
            on a Baumé scale are thus equal in length, while those on a specific-
            gravity scale grow smaller as the density increases, there is no
            simple relation between degrees Bé. and Sp. gr. However, readings on
            Baumés scale may be approximately reduced to specific gravities by
            the following formulæ (x in each case being the reading on Baumé's
            scale) : (a) for liquids heavier than water, sp. gr. = 144 ÷ (144 -
            x);
             (b) for liquids lighter than water, sp. gr. = 144 ÷ (134 + x).</p>

            <p>BE
            Be, v. i. [imp. Was; p. p. Been; p. pr. &amp; vb. n. Being.] Etym: [OE.
            been, beon, AS. beón to be, beóm I am; akin to OHG. bim, pim, G. bin,
            I am, Gael. &amp; Ir. bu was, W. bod to be, Lith. bu-ti, O. Slav. by-ti,
            to be, L. fu-i I have been, fu-turus about to be, fo-re to be about
            to be, and perh to fieri to become, Gr. to be born, to be, Skr. bh to
            be. This verb is defective, and the parts lacking are supplied by
            verbs from other roots, is, was, which have no radical connection
            with be. The various forms, am, are, is, was, were, etc., are
            considered grammatically as parts of the verb "to be", which, with
            its conjugational forms, is often called the substantive verb.
            Future, Physic.]</p>
            <p>1. To exist actually, or in the world of fact; to have ex
            To be contents his natural desire. Pope.
            To be, or not to be: that is the question. Shak.</p>
            <p>2. To exist in a certain manner or relation, — whether as a reality
            or as a product of thought; to exist as the subject of a certain
            predicate, that is, as having a certain attribute, or as belonging to
            a certain sort, or as identical with what is specified, — a word or
            words for the predicate being annexed; as, to be happy; to be here;
            to be large, or strong; to be an animal; to be a hero; to be a
            nonentity; three and two are five; annihilation is the cessation of
            existence; that is the man.</p>
            <p>3. To take place; to happen; as, the meeting was on Thursday.</p>
            <p>4. To signify; to represent or symbolize; to answer to.
            The field is the world. Matt. xiii. 38.
            The seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches. Rev.
            i. 20.</p>
            <p>Note: The verb to be (including the forms is, was, etc.) is used in
            forming the passive voice of other verbs; as, John has been struck by
            James. It is also used with the past participle of many intransitive
            verbs to express a state of the subject. But have is now more
            commonly used as the auxiliary, though expressing a different sense;
            as, "Ye have come too late — but ye are come. " "The minstrel boy to
            the war is gone." The present and imperfect tenses form, with the
            infinitive, a particular future tense, which expresses necessity,
            duty, or purpose; as, government is to be supported; we are to pay
            our just debts; the deed is to be signed to-morrow.</p>
            <p>Note: Have or had been, followed by to, implies movement. "I have
            been to Paris." Sydney Smith. "Have you been to Franchard " R. L.
            Stevenson.</p>
            <p>Note: Been, or ben, was anciently the plural of the indicative
            present. "Ye ben light of the world." Wyclif, Matt. v. 14. Afterwards
            be was used, as in our Bible: "They that be with us are more than
            they that be with them." 2 Kings vi. 16. Ben was also the old
            infinitive: "To ben of such power." R. of Gloucester. Be is used as a
            form of the present subjunctive: "But if it be a question of words
            and names." Acts xviii. 15. But the indicative forms, is and are,
            with if, are more commonly used. Be it so, a phrase of supposition,
            equivalent to suppose it to be so; or of permission, signifying let
            it be so. Shak.
             — If so be, in case.
             — To be from, to have come from; as, from what place are you I am
            from Chicago.
             — To let be, to omit, or leave untouched; to let alone. "Let be,
            therefore, my vengeance to dissuade." Spenser.</p>
            <p>Syn.
             — To be, Exist. The verb to be, except in a few rare case, like
            that of Shakespeare's "To be, or not to be", is used simply as a
            copula, to connect a subject with its predicate; as, man is mortal;
            the soul is immortal. The verb to exist is never properly used as a
            mere copula, but points to things that stand forth, or have a
            substantive being; as, when the soul is freed from all corporeal
            alliance, then it truly exists. It is not, therefore, properly
            synonymous with to be when used as a copula, though occasionally made
            so by some writers for the sake of variety; as in the phrase "there
            exists [is] no reason for laying new taxes." We may, indeed, say, "a
            friendship has long existed between them," instead of saying, "there
            has long been a friendship between them;" but in this case, exist is
            not a mere copula. It is used in its appropriate sense to mark the
            friendship as having been long in existence.</p>

            render an intransitive verb transitive; as, befall (to fall upon);
            bespeak (to speak for). (c) To make the action of a verb particular
            or definite; as, beget (to get as offspring); beset (to set around).</p>
            <p>Note: It is joined with certain substantives, and a few adjectives,
            to form verbs; as, bedew, befriend, benight, besot; belate (to make
            late); belittle (to make little). It also occurs in certain nouns,
            adverbs, and prepositions, often with something of the force of the
            preposition by, or about; as, belief (believe), behalf, bequest
            (bequeath); because, before, beneath, beside, between. In some words
            the original force of be is obscured or lost; as, in become, begin,

            Because of, by reason of, on account of. [Prep. phrase.]
            Because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of
            disobedience. Eph. v. 6.</p>
            <p>Syn, — Because, For, Since, As, Inasmuch As. These particles are
            used, in certain connections, to assign the reason of a thing, or
            that "on account of" which it is or takes place. Because (by cause)
            is the strongest and most emphatic; as, I hid myself because I was
            afraid. For is not quite so strong; as, in Shakespeare, "I hate him,
            for he is a Christian." Since is less formal and more incidental than
            because; as, I will do it since you request me. It more commonly
            begins a sentence; as, Since your decision is made, I will say no
            more. As is still more incidental than since, and points to some
            existing fact by way of assigning a reason. Thus we say, as I knew
            him to be out of town, I did not call. Inasmuch as seems to carry
            with it a kind of qualification which does not belong to the rest.
            Thus, if we say, I am ready to accept your proposal, inasmuch as I
            believe it is the best you can offer, we mean, it is only with this
            understanding that we can accept it.</p>

            <p>Syn.
             — To Beg, Ask, Request. To ask (not in the sense of inquiring) is
            the generic term which embraces all these words. To request is only a
            polite mode of asking. To beg, in its original sense, was to ask with
            earnestness, and implied submission, or at least deference. At
            present, however, in polite life, beg has dropped its original
            meaning, and has taken the place of both ask and request, on the
            ground of its expressing more of deference and respect. Thus, we beg
            a person's acceptance of a present; we beg him to favor us with his
            company; a tradesman begs to announce the arrival of new goods, etc.
            Crabb remarks that, according to present usage, "we can never talk of
            asking a person's acceptance of a thing, or of asking him to do us a
            favor." This can be more truly said of usage in England than in
            America.</p>

            <p>Note: In modern usage, is, are, was or were being, with a past
            participle following (as built, made, etc.) indicates the process
            toward the completed result expressed by the participle. The form is
            or was building, in this passive signification, is idiomatic, and, if
            free from ambiguity, is commonly preferable to the modern is or was
            being built. The last form of speech is, however, sufficiently
            authorized by approved writers. The older expression was is, or was,
            a-building or in building.

             — Benevolence, Beneficence, Munificence. Benevolence marks a
            disposition made up of a choice and desire for the happiness of
            others. Beneficence marks the working of this disposition in
            dispensing good on a somewhat broad scale. Munificence shows the same
            disposition, but acting on a still broader scale, in conferring gifts
            and favors. These are not necessarily confined to objects of
            immediate utility. One may show his munificence in presents of
            pictures or jewelry, but this would not be beneficence. Benevolence
            of heart; beneficence of life; munificence in the encouragement of
            letters.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Defn: Having a disposition to do good; possessing or manifesting love

            disposed to give to good objects; kind; charitable.

            <p>Syn.
             — Benevolent, Beneficent. Etymologically considered, benevolent
            implies wishing well to others, and beneficent, doing well. But by
            degrees the word benevolent has been widened to include not only
            feelings, but actions; thus, we speak of benevolent operations,
            benevolent labors for the public good, benevolent societies. In like
            manner, beneficent is now often applied to feelings; thus, we speak
            of the beneficent intentions of a donor. This extension of the terms
            enables us to mark nicer shades of meaning. Thus, the phrase
            "benevolent labors" turns attention to the source of these labors,
            viz., benevolent feeling; while beneficent would simply mark them as
            productive of good. So, "beneficent intentions" point to the feelings
            of the donor as bent upon some specific good act; while "benevolent
            intentions" would only denote a general wish and design to do good.</p>

             — Predilection; turn. Bent, Bias, Inclination, Prepossession. These
            words agree in describing a permanent influence upon the mind which
            tends to decide its actions. Bent denotes a fixed tendency of the
            mind in a given direction. It is the widest of these terms, and
            applies to the will, the intellect, and the affections, taken
            conjointly; as, the whole bent of his character was toward evil
            practices. Bias is literally a weight fixed on one side of a ball
            used in bowling, and causing it to swerve from a straight course.
            Used figuratively, bias applies particularly to the judgment, and
            denotes something which acts with a permanent force on the character
            through that faculty; as, the bias of early education, early habits,
            etc. Inclination is an excited state of desire or appetency; as, a
            strong inclination to the study of the law. Prepossession is a
            mingled state of feeling and opinion in respect to some person or
            subject, which has laid hold of and occupied the mind previous to
            inquiry. The word is commonly used in a good sense, an unfavorable
            impression of this kind being denominated a prejudice. "Strong minds
            will be strongly bent, and usually labor under a strong bias; but
            there is no mind so weak and powerless as not to have its
            inclinations, and none so guarded as to be without its
            prepossessions." Crabb.</p>

            given is called the devisee. Bequeath is properly applied to a gift
            by will or legacy; i. e., of personal property; the gift is called a
            legacy, and he who receives it is called a legatee. In popular usage
            the word bequeath is sometimes enlarged so as to embrace devise; and
            it is sometimes so construed by courts.</p>

            <p>1. To ask or entreat with urgency; to supplicate; to implore.

            But Eve . . . besought his peace. Milton.</p>
            <p>Syn.
             — To beg; to crave.
             — To Beseech, Entreat, Solicit, Implore, Supplicate. These words
            agree in marking that sense of want which leads men to beg some
            favor. To solicit is to make a request, with some degree of
            earnestness and repetition, of one whom we address as a superior. To
            entreat implies greater urgency, usually enforced by adducing reasons
            or arguments. To beseech is still stronger, and belongs rather to the
            language of poetry and imagination. To implore denotes increased
            fervor of entreaty, as addressed either to equals or superiors. To
            supplicate expresses the extreme of entreaty, and usually implies a
            state of deep humiliation. Thus, a captive supplicates a conqueror to
            spare his life. Men solicit by virtue of their interest with another;
            they entreat in the use of reasoning and strong representations; they
            beseech with importunate earnestness; they implore from a sense of
            overwhelming distress; they supplicate with a feeling of the most
            absolute inferiority and dependence.</p>

             — Beside, Besides. These words, whether used as prepositions or
            adverbs, have been considered strictly synonymous, from an early
            period of our literature, and have been freely interchanged by our
            best writers. There is, however, a tendency, in present usage, to
            make the following distinction between them: 1. That beside be used
            only and always as a preposition, with the original meaning "by the
            side of; " as, to sit beside a fountain; or with the closely allied
            meaning "aside from", "apart from", or "out of"; as, this is beside
            our present purpose; to be beside one's self with joy. The adverbial
            sense to be wholly transferred to the cognate word. 2. That besides,
            as a preposition, take the remaining sense "in addition to", as,
            besides all this; besides the considerations here offered. "There was
            a famine in the land besides the first famine." Gen. xxvi. 1. And
            that it also take the adverbial sense of "moreover", "beyond", etc.,
            which had been divided between the words; as, besides, there are
            other considerations which belong to this case. The following
            passages may serve to illustrate this use of the words: —
            Lovely Thais sits beside thee. Dryden.
            Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude, beside
            themselves with fear. Shak.

            <p>Syn.
             — Burden, Load. A burden is, in the literal sense, a weight to be
            borne; a load is something laid upon us to be carried. Hence, when
            used figuratively, there is usually a difference between the two
            words. Our burdens may be of such a nature that we feel bound to bear
            them cheerfully or without complaint. They may arise from the nature
            of our situation; they may be allotments of Providence; they may be
            the consequences of our errors. What is upon us, as a load, we
            commonly carry with greater reluctance or sense of oppression. Men
            often find the charge of their own families to be a burden; but if to
            this be added a load of care for others, the pressure is usually
            serve and irksome.</p>

            <p>Note: To the meaning of by, as denoting means or agency, belong, more
            or less closely, most of the following uses of the word: (a) It
            points out the author and producer; as, "Waverley", a novel by Sir
            W.Scott; a statue by Canova; a sonata by Beethoven. (b) In an oath or

            anything is done; as, to beat one with a stick; the board was
            fastened by the carpenter with nails. But there are many words which
            may be regarded as means or processes, or, figuratively, as
            instruments; and whether with or by shall be used with them is a
            matter of arbitrary, and often, of unsettled usage; as, to a reduce a
            town by famine; to consume stubble with fire; he gained his purpose
            by flattery; he entertained them with a story; he distressed us with

            before long.</p>
            <p>Note: In this phrase, by seems to be used in the sense of nearness in
            time, and to be repeated for the sake of emphasis, and thus to be
            equivalent to "soon, and soon," that is instantly; hence, — less
            emphatically, — pretty soon, presently.

            <p>Note: The common phrase good-by is equivalent to farewell, and would
            be better written good-bye, as it is a corruption of God be with you
