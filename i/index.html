            <h2><a id="chap09"></a>I</h2>
            <p>1. I, the ninth letter of the English alphabet, takes its form from
            the Phoenician, through the Latin and the Greek. The Phoenician
            letter was probably of Egyptian origin. Its original value was nearly
            the same as that of the Italian I, or long e as in mete.
            Etymologically I is most closely related to e, y, j, g; as in dint,
            dent, beverage, L. bibere; E. kin, AS. cynn; E. thin, AS. ynne; E.
            dominion, donjon, dungeon. In English I has two principal vowel
            sounds: the long sound, as in pine, ice; and the short sound, as in
            pîn. It has also three other sounds: (a) That of e in term, as in
            thirst. (b) That of e in mete (in words of foreign origin), as in
            machine, pique, regime. (c) That of consonant y (in many words in
            which it precedes another vowel), as in bunion, million, filial,
            Christian, etc. It enters into several digraphs, as in fail, field,
            seize, feign. friend; and with o often forms a proper diphtong, as in
            oil, join, coin.</p>
            <p>See Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 98-106.</p>
            <p>Note: The dot which we place over the small or lower case i dates
            only from the 14th century. The sounds of I and J were originally
            represented by the same character, and even after the introduction of
            the form J into English dictionaries, words containing these letters
            were, till a comparatively recent time, classed together.</p>
            <p>2. In our old authors, I was often used for ay (or aye), yes, which
            is pronounced nearly like it.</p>
            <p>3. As a numeral, I stands for 1, II for 2, etc.</p>

            imitation of the use of the Greek plurals ics were construed with a
            verb or a pronoun in the plural; but it is now generally considered
            preferable to treat them as singular. In Greman we have die

            <p>1. The syntactical or structural form peculiar to any language; the
            genius or cast of a language.
            Idiom may be employed loosely and figuratively as a synonym of
            language or dialect, but in its proper sense it signifies the
            totality of the general rules of construction which characterize the
            syntax of a particular language and distinguish it from other
            tongues. G. P. Marsh.
            By idiom is meant the use of words which is peculiar to a particular
            language. J. H. Newman.
            He followed their language [the Latin], but did not comply with the
            idiom of ours. Dryden.</p>
            <p>2. An expression conforming or appropriate to the peculiar structural
            form of a language; in extend use, an expression sanctioned by usage,
            having a sense peculiar to itself and not agreeing with the logical
            sense of its structural form; also, the phrase forms peculiar to a
            particular author.
            Some that with care true eloquence shall teach, And to just idioms
            fix our doubtful speech. Prior.
            Sometimes we identify the words with the object — though be courtesy
            of idiom rather than in strict propriety of language. Coleridge.
            Every good writer has much idiom. Landor.
            It is not by means of rules that such idioms as the following are
            made current: "I can make nothing of it." "He treats his subject
            home." Dryden. "It is that within us that makes for righteousness."
            M.Arnold. Gostwick (Eng. Gram. )</p>

             — Idiom, Dialect. The idioms of a language belong to its very
            structure; its dialects are varieties of expression ingrafted upon it
            in different localities or by different professions. Each county of
            England has some peculiarities of dialect, and so have most of the
            professions, while the great idioms of the language are everywhere
            the same. See Language.</p>

            <p>IMAGINATION
            Im*ag`i*na"tion, n. Etym: [OE. imaginacionum, F. imagination, fr. L.
            imaginatio. See Imagine.]</p>
            <p>1. The imagine-making power of the mind; the power to create or
            reproduce ideally an object of sense previously perceived; the power
            to call up mental imagines.
            Our simple apprehension of corporeal objects, if present, is sense;
            if absent, is imagination. Glanvill.
            Imagination is of three kinds: joined with belief of that which is to
            come; joined with memory of that which is past; and of things
            present, or as if they were present. Bacon.</p>
            <p>2. The representative power; the power to reconstruct or recombine
            the materials furnished by direct apprehension; the complex faculty
            usually termed the plastic or creative power; the fancy.
            The imagination of common language — the productive imagination of
            philosophers — is nothing but the representative process plus the
            process to which I would give the name of the "comparative." Sir W.
            Hamilton.
            The power of the mind to decompose its conceptions, and to recombine
            the elements of them at its pleasure, is called its faculty of
            imagination. I. Taylor.
            The business of conception is to present us with an exact transcript
            of what we have felt or perceived. But we have moreover a power of
            modifying our conceptions, by combining the parts of different ones
            together, so as to form new wholes of our creation. I shall employ
            the word imagination to express this power. Stewart.</p>
            <p>3. The power to recombine the materials furnished by experience or
            memory, for the accomplishment of an elevated purpose; the power of
            conceiving and expressing the ideal.
            The lunatic, the lover, and the poet Are of imagination all compact .
            . . The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling, Doth glance from heaven
            to earth, from earth to heaven, And as imagination bodies forth The
            forms of things unknown, the poet's pen Turns them to shapes, and
            gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name. Shak.</p>
            <p>4. A mental image formed by the action of the imagination as a
            faculty; a conception; a notion. Shak.</p>
            <p>Syn.
             — Conception; idea; conceit; fancy; device; origination; invention;
            scheme; design; purpose; contrivance.
             — Imagination, Fancy. These words have, to a great extent, been
            interchanged by our best writers, and considered as strictly
            synonymous. A distinction, however, is now made between them which
            more fully exhibits their nature. Properly speaking, they are
            different exercises of the same general power — the plastic or
            creative faculty. Imagination consists in taking parts of our
            conceptions and combining them into new forms and images more select,
            more striking, more delightful, more terrible, etc., than those of
            ordinary nature. It is the higher exercise of the two. It creates by
            laws more closely connected with the reason; it has strong emotion as
            its actuating and formative cause; it aims at results of a definite
            and weighty character. Milton's fiery lake, the debates of his
            Pandemonium, the exquisite scenes of his Paradise, are all products
            of the imagination. Fancy moves on a lighter wing; it is governed by
            laws of association which are more remote, and sometimes arbitrary or
            capricious. Hence the term fanciful, which exhibits fancy in its
            wilder flights. It has for its actuating spirit feelings of a lively,
            gay, and versatile character; it seeks to please by unexpected
            combinations of thought, startling contrasts, flashes of brilliant
            imagery, etc. Pope's Rape of the Lock is an exhibition of fancy which
            has scarcely its equal in the literature of any country.
             — "This, for instance, Wordworth did in respect of the words
            `imagination' and `fancy.' Before he wrote, it was, I suppose,
            obscurely felt by most that in `imagination' there was more of the
            earnest, in `fancy' of the play of the spirit; that the first was a
            loftier faculty and gift than the second; yet for all this words were
            continually, and not without loss, confounded. He first, in the
            preface to his Lyrical Ballads, rendered it henceforth impossible
            that any one, who had read and mastered what he has written on the
            two words, should remain unconscious any longer of the important
            difference between them." Trench.
            The same power, which we should call fancy if employed on a
            production of a light nature, would be dignified with the title of
            imagination if shown on a grander scale. C. J. Smith.</p>

            time, but we break away from it.

             — Impertinent, Officious, Rude. A person is officious who obtrudes
            his offices or assistance where they are not needed; he is
            impertinent when he intermeddles in things with which he has no
            concern. The former shows a want of tact, the latter a want of
            breeding, or, more commonly, a spirit of sheer impudence. A person is
            rude when he violates the proprieties of social life either from
            ignorance or wantonness. "An impertinent man will ask questions for
            the mere grafication of curiosity; a rude man will burst into the
            room of another, or push against his person, inviolant of all
            decorum; one who is officious is quite as unfortunate as he is
            troublesome; when he strives to serve, he has the misfortune to
            annoy." Crabb. See Impudence, and Insolent.</p>

             — Inconsistent, Incongruous, Incompatible. Things are incongruous
            when they are not suited to each other, so that their union is
            unbecoming; inconsistent when they are opposed to each other, so as
            render it improper or wrong; incompatible when they can not coexist,
            and it is therefore impossible to unite them. Habitual levity of mind

            things; incompatibility attaches to their essential attributes;

            <p>2. A cycle of fifteen years.</p>
            <p>Note: This mode of reckoning time is said to have been introduced by
            Constantine the Great, in connection with the payment of tribute. It
            was adopted at various times by the Greek emperors of Constantinople,
            the popes, and the parliaments of France. Through the influence of
            the popes, it was extensively used in the ecclesiastical chronology
            of the Middle Ages. The number of indictions was reckoned at first
            from 312 a. d., but since the twelfth century it has been reckoned
            from the birth of Christ. The papal indiction is the only one ever
            used at the present day. To find the indiction and year of the
            indiction by the first method, subtract 312 from the given year a.
            d., and divide by 15; by the second method, add 3 to the given year
            a. d., and the divide by 15. In either case, the quotient is the
            number of the current indiction, and the remainder the year of the
            indiction. See Cycle of indiction, under Cycle.</p>

            As there is a great truth wrapped up in "diligence," what a lie, on
            the other hand, lurks at the root of our present use of the word
            "indolence"! This is from "in" and "doleo," not to grieve; and
            indolence is thus a state in which we have no grief or pain; so that
            the word, as we now employ it, seems to affirm that indulgence in
            sloth and ease is that which would constitute for us the absence of
            all pain. Trench.</p>

            affinities, from mixture with whom sprang the Indonesian race.</p>
            <p>The term Indonesian, introduced by Logan to designate the light-
            colored non-Malay inhabitants of the Eastern Archipelago, is now used
            as a convenient collective name for all the peoples of Malaysia and
            Polynesia who are neither Malay nor Papuans, but of Caucasic type.  .

            generally brachycephalous like that of the melanochroic European.

            <p>The Indonesians [of the Philippines], with the tribal population of
            some 251, 200, live almost exclusively on the great island of
            Mindanao. They are not only physically superior to the Negritos, but
            to the peoples of the Malayan race as well, and are, as a rule, quite

            Induction is an inference drawn from all the particulars. Sir W.
            Hamilton.
            Induction is the process by which we conclude that what is true of
            certain individuals of a class, is true of the whole class, or that
            what is true at certain times will be true in similar circumstances

            depend on the preceding one; — called also successive induction.</p>
            <p>6. (Physics)</p>
            <p>Defn: The property by which one body, having electrical or magnetic
            polarity, causes or induces it in another body without direct
            contact; an impress of electrical or magnetic force or condition from
            one body on another without actual contact. Electro-dynamic
            induction, the action by which a variable or interrupted current of
            electricity excites another current in a neighboring conductor
            forming a closed circuit.
             — Electro-magnetic induction, the influence by which an electric
            current produces magnetic polarity in certain bodies near or around
            which it passes.
             — Electro-static induction, the action by which a body possessing a
            charge of statical electricity develops a charge of statical
            electricity of the opposite character in a neighboring body.
             — Induction coil, an apparatus producing induced currents of great
            intensity. It consists of a coil or helix of stout insulated copper
            wire, surrounded by another coil of very fine insulated wire, in
            which a momentary current is induced, when a current (as from a
            voltaic battery), passing through the inner coil, is made, broken, or
            varied. The inner coil has within it a core of soft iron, and is
            connected at its terminals with a condenser; — called also
            inductorium, and Ruhmkorff's coil.
             — Induction pipe, port, or valve, a pipe, passageway, or valve, for
            leading or admitting a fluid to a receiver, as steam to an engine
            cylinder, or water to a pump.
             — Magnetic induction, the action by which magnetic polarity is
            developed in a body susceptible to magnetic effects when brought
            under the influence of a magnet.
             — Magneto-electric induction, the influence by which a magnet
            excites electric currents in closed circuits. Logical induction,
            (Philos.), an act or method of reasoning from all the parts
            separately to the whole which they constitute, or into which they may
            be united collectively; the operation of discovering and proving
            general propositions; the scientific method.
             — Philosophical induction, the inference, or the act of inferring,
            that what has been observed or established in respect to a part,
            individual, or species, may, on the ground of analogy, be affirmed or
            received of the whole to which it belongs. This last is the inductive
            method of Bacon. It ascends from the parts to the whole, and forms,
            from the general analogy of nature, or special presumptions in the
            case, conclusions which have greater or less degrees of force, and
            which may be strengthened or weakened by subsequent experience and
            experiment. It relates to actual existences, as in physical science
            or the concerns of life. Logical induction is founded on the
            necessary laws of thought; philosophical induction, on the
            interpretation of the indications or analogy of nature.</p>
            <p>Syn.
             — Deduction.
             — Induction, Deduction. In induction we observe a sufficient number
            of individual facts, and, on the ground of analogy, extend what is
            true of them to others of the same class, thus arriving at general
            principles or laws. This is the kind of reasoning in physical
            science. In deduction we begin with a general truth, which is already
            proven or provisionally assumed, and seek to connect it with some
            particular case by means of a middle term, or class of objects, known
            to be equally connected with both. Thus, we bring down the general
            into the particular, affirming of the latter the distinctive
            qualities of the former. This is the syllogistic method. By induction
            Franklin established the identity of lightning and electricity; by
            deduction he inferred that dwellings might be protected by lightning
            rods.</p>

            - called also asynchronous generator. Below synchronism the machine
            takes in electrical energy and acts as an induction motor; at
            synchronism the power component of current becomes zero and changes
            sign, so that above synchronism the machine (driven for this purpose
            by mechanical power) gives out electrical energy as a generator.</p>

            lifeless; irresolute; stupid; senseless; insensible.
             — Inert, Inactive, Sluggish. A man may be inactive from mere want
            of stimulus to effort; but one who is inert has something in his
            constitution or his habits which operates like a weight holding him
            back from exertion. Sluggish is still stronger, implying some defect
            of temperament which directly impedes action. Inert and inactive are
            negative, sluggish is positive.

            In"fer*ence, n. Etym: [From Infer.]
            </p>
            <p>1. The act or process of inferring by deduction or induction.
            Though it may chance to be right in the conclusions, it is yet unjust

            <p>2. That which inferred; a truth or proposition drawn from another
            which is admitted or supposed to be true; a conclusion; a deduction.
            Milton.
            These inferences, or conclusions, are the effects of reasoning, and
            the three propositions, taken all together, are called syllogism, or
            argument. I. Watts.</p>
            <p>Syn.
             — Conclusion; deduction; consequence.
             — Inference, Conclusion. An inference is literally that which is
            brought in; and hence, a deduction or induction from premises, —
            something which follows as certainly or probably true. A conclusion
            is stronger than an inference; it shuts us up to the result, and
            terminates inquiry. We infer what is particular or probable; we
            conclude what is certain. In a chain of reasoning we have many
            inferences, which lead to the ultimate conclusion. "An inference is a
            proposition which is perceived to be true, because of its connection
            with some known fact." "When something is simply affirmed to be true,
            it is called a proposition; after it has been found to be true by
            several reasons or arguments, it is called a conclusion." I. Taylor.</p>

            <p>INFIDEL<br>
            In"fi*del, n.
            </p>
            <p>Defn: One who does not believe in the prevailing religious faith;
            especially, one who does not believe in the divine origin and

            <p>Syn.
             — Infidel, Unbeliever, Freethinker, Deist, Atheist, Sceptic,
            Agnostic. An infidel, in common usage, is one who denies Christianity
            and the truth of the Scriptures. Some have endeavored to widen the
            sense of infidel so as to embrace atheism and every form of unbelief;
            but this use does not generally prevail. A freethinker is now only
            another name for an infidel. An unbeliever is not necessarily a
            disbeliever or infidel, because he may still be inquiring after
            evidence to satisfy his mind; the word, however, is more commonly
            used in the extreme sense. A deist believes in one God and a divine
            providence, but rejects revelation. An atheist denies the being of
            God. A sceptic is one whose faith in the credibility of evidence is
            weakened or destroyed, so that religion, to the same extent, has no
            practical hold on his mind. An agnostic remains in a state of
            suspended judgment, neither affirming nor denying the existence of a
            personal Deity.</p>
            <p>INFIDELITY

            want of faith in, or disbelief of, the inspiration of the Scriptures,
            of the divine origin of Christianity.
            There is, indeed, no doubt but that vanity is one of the principal
            causes of infidelity. V. Knox.</p>
            <p>2. Unfaithfulness to the marriage vow or contract; violation of the
            marriage covenant by adultery.</p>
            <p>3. Breach of trust; unfaithfulness to a charge, or to moral
            obligation; treachery; deceit; as, the infidelity of a servant. "The

            forms in English: (a) The simple form, as, speak, go, hear, before
            which to is commonly placed, as, to speak; to go; to hear. (b) The
            form of the imperfect participle, called the infinitive in -ing; as,
            going is as easy as standing.</p>
            <p>Note: With the auxiliary verbs may, can, must, might, could, would,
            and should, the simple infinitive is expressed without to; as, you
            may speak; they must hear, etc. The infinitive usually omits to with
            the verbs let, dare, do, bid, make, see, hear, need, etc.; as, let me
            go; you dare not tell; make him work; hear him talk, etc.</p>
            <p>Note: In Anglo-Saxon, the simple infinitive was not preceded by to
            (the sign of modern simple infinitive), but it had a dative form
            (sometimes called the gerundial infinitive) which was preceded by to,
            and was chiefly employed in expressing purpose. See Gerund, 2.</p>
            <p>Note: The gerundial ending (-anne) not only took the same form as the
            simple infinitive (-an), but it was confounded with the present
            participle in -ende, or -inde (later -inge).</p>

             — Insolent, Insulting. Insolent, in its primitive sense, simply

            <p>INTERNAL-COMBUSTION; INTERNAL-COMBUSTION ENGINE<br>
            In*ter"nal-com*bus"tion, a. (Mach.)
            </p>
            <p>Defn: Designating, or pertaining to, any engine (called an Internal-
            combustion engine) in which the heat or pressure energy necessary to
            produce motion is developed in the engine cylinder, as by the
            explosion of a gas, and not in a separate chamber, as in a steam-
            engine boiler. The gas used may be a fixed gas, or one derived from
            alcohol, ether, gasoline (petrol), naphtha, oil (petroleum), etc.
            There are three main classes: (1) gas engines proper, using fixed
            gases, as coal, blast-furnace, or producer gas; (2) engines using the
            vapor of a volatile fluid, as the typical gasoline (petrol) engine;
            (3) oil engines, using either an atomized spray or the vapor
            (produced by heat) of a comparatively heavy oil, as petroleum or
            kerosene. In all of these the gas is mixed with a definite amount of
            air, the charge is composed in the cylinder and is then exploded
            either by a flame of gas (flame ignition — now little used), by a
            hot tube (tube ignition) or the like, by an electric spark (electric
            ignition, the usual method is gasoline engines, or by the heat of
            compression, as in the Diesel engine. Gas and oil engines are chiefly
            of the stationary type. Gasoline engines are largely used for
            automobile vehicles, boats, etc. Most internal-combustion engines use
            the Otto (four-stroke) cycle, though many use the two-stroke cycle.
            They are almost universally trunk engines and single-acting. Because
            of the intense heat produced by the frequent explosions, the
            cylinders must be cooled by a water jacket (water-cooled) or by air
            currents (air cooled) to give the maximum thermodynamic efficiency
            and to avoid excessive friction or seizing.</p>

             — International law, the rules regulating the mutual intercourse of
            nations. International law is mainly the product of the conditions
            from time to time of international intercourse, being drawn from
            diplomatic discussion, textbooks, proof of usage, and from recitals
            in treaties. It is called public when treating of the relations of
            sovereign powers, and private when of the relations of persons of
            different nationalities. International law is now, by the better
            opinion, part of the common law of the land. Cf. Conflict of laws,
            under Conflict. Wharton.</p>

            </p>

            <p>Syn.
             — To imply; include; implicate; complicate; entangle; embarrass;
            overwhelm.
             — To Involve, Imply. Imply is opposed to express, or set forth;
            thus, an implied engagement is one fairly to be understood from the
            words used or the circumstances of the case, though not set forth in
            form. Involve goes beyond the mere interpretation of things into
            their necessary relations; and hence, if one thing involves another,
            it so contains it that the two must go together by an indissoluble
            connection. War, for example, involves wide spread misery and death;
            the premises of a syllogism involve the conclusion.</p>

            </p>
            <p>1. (Chem.)</p>
            <p>Defn: The most common and most useful metallic element, being of
            almost universal occurrence, usually in the form of an oxide (as
            hematite, magnetite, etc.), or a hydrous oxide (as limonite, turgite,
            etc.). It is reduced on an enormous scale in three principal forms;
            viz., cast iron, steel, and wrought iron. Iron usually appears dark
            brown, from oxidation or impurity, but when pure, or an fresh
            surface, is a gray or white metal. It is easily oxidized (rusted) by
            moisture, and is attacked by many corrosive agents. Symbol Fe (Latin
            Ferrum). Atomic weight 55.9. Specific gravity, pure iron, 7.86; cast
            iron, 7.1. In magnetic properties, it is superior to all other
            substances.</p>
            <p>Note: The value of iron is largely due to the facility with which it
            can be worked. Thus, when heated it is malleable and ductile, and can
            be easily welded and forged at a high temperature. As cast iron, it
            is easily fusible; as steel, is very tough, and (when tempered) very
            hard and elastic. Chemically, iron is grouped with cobalt and nickel.
            Steel is a variety of iron containing more carbon than wrought iron,
            but less that cast iron. It is made either from wrought iron, by
            roasting in a packing of carbon (cementation) or from cast iron, by
            burning off the impurities in a Bessemer converter (then called
            Bessemer steel), or directly from the iron ore (as in the Siemens
            rotatory and generating furnace).</p>
            <p>2. An instrument or utensil made of iron; — chiefly in composition;
            as, a flatiron, a smoothing iron, etc.

             — Bog iron, bog ore; limonite. See Bog ore, under Bog.
             — Cast iron (Metal.), an impure variety of iron, containing from
            three to six percent of carbon, part of which is united with a part
            of the iron, as a carbide, and the rest is uncombined, as graphite.
            It there is little free carbon, the product is white iron; if much of
            the carbon has separated as graphite, it is called gray iron. See
            also Cast iron, in the Vocabulary.

             — Magnetic iron. See Magnetite.
             — Malleable iron (Metal.), iron sufficiently pure or soft to be
            capable of extension under the hammer; also, specif., a kind of iron
            produced by removing a portion of the carbon or other impurities from
            cast iron, rendering it less brittle, and to some extent malleable.
             — Meteoric iron (Chem.), iron forming a large, and often the chief,
            ingredient of meteorites. It invariably contains a small amount of
            nickel and cobalt. Cf. Meteorite.
             — Pig iron, the form in which cast iron is made at the blast
            furnace, being run into molds, called pigs.

            Instead of being looked upon as an affix, it passed for part of the
            original word. Hence was formed from it the anomalous genitive it,
