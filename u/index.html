            <h2><a id="chap21"></a>U</h2>
            <p>Defn: U, the twenty-first letter of the English alphabet, is a
            cursive form of the letter V, with which it was formerly used
            interchangeably, both letters being then used both as vowels and
            consonants. U and V are now, however, differentiated, U being used
            only as a vowel or semivowel, and V only as a consonant. The true
            primary vowel sound of U, in Anglo-Saxon, was the sound which it
            still retains in most of the languages of Europe, that of long oo, as
            in tool, and short oo, as in wood, answering to the French ou in
            tour. Etymologically U is most closely related to o, y (vowel), w,
            and v; as in two, duet, dyad, twice; top, tuft; sop, sup; auspice,
            aviary. See V, also O and Y. See Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 130-144.</p>

            To verbs to express the contrary, and not the simple negative, of the
            action of the verb to which it is prefixed; as in uncoil, undo,
            unfold. (b) To nouns to form verbs expressing privation of the thing,
            quality, or state expressed by the noun, or separation from it; as in
            unchild, unsex. Sometimes particles and participial adjectives formed
            with this prefix coincide in form with compounds of the negative
            prefix un- (see 2d Un-); as in undone (from undo), meaning
            unfastened, ruined; and undone (from 2d un- and done) meaning not

            In- is prefixed mostly to words of Latin origin, or else to words
            formed by Latin suffixes; un- is of much wider application, and is
            attached at will to almost any adjective, or participle used
            adjectively, or adverb, from which it may be desired to form a
            corresponding negative adjective or adverb, and is also, but less
            freely, prefixed to nouns. Un- sometimes has merely an intensive
            force; as in unmerciless, unremorseless. I.</p>
            <p>Defn: Un- is prefixed to adjectives, or to words used adjectively.

            <p>(c) To present particles which come from intransitive verbs, or are
            themselves employed as adjectives, to mark the absence of the
            activity, disposition, or condition implied by the participle; as, —
            —- and the like.</p>
            <p>Note: The above classes of words are unlimited in extent, and such
            compounds may be formed by any writer or speaker at will from almost
            all the adjectives or participles in the language, excepting those
            which have a recognized and usual negative correspondent with the
            prefix -in. No attempt will be made, therefore, to define them all in
            this Dictionary; many will be omitted from its Vocabulary which are
            negations of the simple word, and are readily explained by prefixing
            a not to the latter. Derivatives of these words in -ly and -ness will
            also, for the most part, be omitted for the same or similar reasons.
            There will be inserted as separate articles with definitions, the
            following: —1. Those which have acquired an opposed or contrary,
            instead of a merely negative, meaning; as, unfriendly, ungraceful,
            unpalatable, unquiet, and the like; or else an intensive sense more
            than a prefixed not would express; as, unending, unparalleled,
            undisciplined, undoubted, unsafe, and the like. 2. Those which have
            the value of independent words, inasmuch as the simple words are
            either not used at all, or are rarely, or at least much less
            frequently, used; as, unavoidable, unconscionable, undeniable,
            unspeakable, unprecedented, unruly, and the like; or inasmuch as they
            are used in a different sense from the usual meaning of the
            primitive, or especially in one of the significations of the latter;
            as, unaccountable, unalloyed, unbelieving, unpretending, unreserved,
            and the like; or inasmuch as they are so frequently and familiarly
            used that they are hardly felt to be of negative origin; as,
            uncertain, uneven, and the like. 3. Those which are anomalous,
            provincial, or, for some other reason, not desirable to be used, and
            are so indicated; as, unpure for impure, unsatisfaction for
            dissatisfaction, unexpressible for inexpressible, and the like. II.</p>
            <p>Defn: Un- is prefixed to nouns to express the absence of, or the

            There is a spirit in man; and the inspiration of the Almighty them
            understanding. Job xxxii. 8.
            The power of perception is that which we call the understanding.
            Perception, which we make the act of the understanding, is of three
            sorts: 1. The perception of ideas in our mind; 2. The perception of
            the signification of signs; 3. The perception of the connection or
            repugnancy, agreement or disagreement, that there is between any of
            our ideas. All these are attributed to the understanding, or
            perceptive power, though it be the two latter only that use allows us
            to say we understand. Locke.
            In its wider acceptation, understanding is the entire power of
            perceiving an conceiving, exclusive of the sensibility: the power of
            dealing with the impressions of sense, and composing them into
            wholes, according to a law of unity; and in its most comprehensive
            meaning it includes even simple apprehension. Coleridge.</p>

            I use the term understanding, not for the noetic faculty, intellect
            proper, or place of principles, but for the dianoetic or discursive
            faculty in its widest signification, for the faculty of relations or
            comparisons; and thus in the meaning in which "verstand" is now
            employed by the Germans. Sir W. Hamilton.</p>

            <p>UNDULATORY<br>
            Un"du*la*to*ry, a. Etym: [Cf. F. ondulatoire.]
            </p>
            <p>Defn: Moving in the manner of undulations, or waves; resembling the
            motion of waves, which successively rise or swell rise or swell and
            fall; pertaining to a propagated alternating motion, similar to that
            of waves. Undulatory theory, or Wave theory (of light) (Opt.), that
            theory which regards its various phenomena as due to undulations in
            an ethereal medium, propagated from the radiant with immense, but
            measurable, velocities, and producing different impressions on the
            retina according to their amplitude and frequency, the sensation of
            brightness depending on the former, that of color on the latter. The
            undulations are supposed to take place, not in the direction of
            propagation, as in the air waves constituting sound, but
            transversely, and the various phenomena of refraction, polarization,
            interference, etc., are attributable to the different affections of
            these undulations in different circumstances of propagation. It is
            computed that the frequency of the undulations corresponding to the
            several colors of the spectrum ranges from 458 millions of millions
            per second for the extreme red ray, to 727 millions of millions for
            the extreme violet, and their lengths for the same colors, from the
            thirty-eight thousandth to the sixty thousandth part of an inch. The
            theory of ethereal undulations is applicable not only to the
            phenomena of light, but also to those of heat.</p>

            money, by which its several denominations are regulated, and which is
            itself defined by comparison with some known magnitude, either
            natural or empirical, as, in the United States, the dollar for money,
            the pound avoirdupois for weight, the yard for length, the gallon of
            8.3389 pounds avoirdupois of water at 39.8º Fahr. (about 231 cubic

             — Universal instrument (Astron.), a species of altitude and azimuth
            instrument, the peculiarity of which is, that the object end of the
            telescope is placed at right angles to the eye end, with a prism of
            total reflection at the angle, and the eye end constitutes a portion
            of the horizontal axis of the instrument, having the eyepiece at the
            pivot and in the center of the altitude circle, so that the eye has
            convenient access to both at the same time.
             — Universal joint (Mach.), a contrivance used for joining two
            shafts or parts of a machine endwise, so that the one may give rotary
            motion to the other when forming an angle with it, or may move freely
            in all directions with respect to the other, as by means of a cross
            connecting the forked ends of the two shafts (Fig. 1). Since this
            joint can not act when the angle of the shafts is less than 140º, a
            double joint of the same kind is sometimes used for giving rotary
            motion at angles less than 140º (Fig. 2).

            <p>2. An association, society, guild, or corporation, esp. one capable

            The universities, or corporate bodies, at Rome were very numerous.
            There were corporations of bakers, farmers of the revenue, scribes,
            and others. Eng. Cyc.</p>
            <p>3. An institution organized and incorporated for the purpose of
            imparting instruction, examining students, and otherwise promoting
            education in the higher branches of literature, science, art, etc.,
            empowered to confer degrees in the several arts and faculties, as in
            theology, law, medicine, music, etc. A university may exist without
            having any college connected with it, or it may consist of but one
            college, or it may comprise an assemblage of colleges established in
            any place, with professors for instructing students in the sciences
            and other branches of learning.
            The present universities of Europe were, originally, the greater part
            of them, ecclesiastical corporations, instituted for the education of
            churchmen . . . What was taught in the greater part of those
            universities was suitable to the end of their institutions, either
            theology or something that was merely preparatory to theology. A.
            Smith.</p>
            <p>Note: From the Roman words universitas, collegium, corpus, are
            derived the terms university, college, and corporation, of modern
            languages; and though these words have obtained modified
            significations in modern times, so as to indifferently applicable to
            the same things, they all agree in retaining the fundamental
            signification of the terms, whatever may have been added to them.
            There is now no university, college, or corporation, which is not a
            juristical person in the sense above explained [see def. 2, above];
            wherever these words are applied to any association of persons not
            stamped with this mark, it is an abuse of terms. Eng. Cyc.</p>

            less employed than it used to be, on having for the most part taken
            its place. Some expressions formed with it belong only to old style;
            as, upon pity they were taken away; that is, in consequence of pity:
            upon the rate of thirty thousand; that is, amounting to the rate: to

            upon; that is, upon himself: the time is coming fast upon; that is,
            upon the present time. By the omission of its object, upon acquires
            an adverbial sense, as in the last two examples. To assure upon
            (Law), to promise; to undertake.

            </p>
            <p>Defn: A very soluble crystalline body which is the chief constituent
            of the urine in mammals and some other animals. It is also present in
            small quantity in blood, serous fluids, lymph, the liver, etc.</p>
            <p>Note: It is the main product of the regressive metamorphosis
            (katabolism) of proteid matter in the body, and is excreted daily to
            the amount of about 500 grains by a man of average weight. Chemically
            it is carbamide, CO(NH2)2, and when heated with strong acids or
            alkalies is decomposed into carbonic acid and ammonia. It unites with
            acids to form salts, as nitrate of urea, and it can be made
            synthetically from ammonium cyanate, with which it is isomeric. Urea
            ferment, a soluble ferment formed by certain bacteria, which,
            however, yield the ferment from the body of their cells only after
            they have been killed by alcohol. It causes urea to take up water and
            decompose into carbonic acid and ammonia. Many different bacteria
            possess this property, especially Bacterium ureæ and Micrococcus
            ureæ, which are found abundantly in urines undergoing alkaline
            fermentation.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Defn: Of or pertaining to urine; obtained from urine; as, uric acid.
            Uric acid, a crystalline body, present in small quantity in the urine
            of man and most mammals. Combined in the form of urate of ammonia, it
            is the chief constituent of the urine of birds and reptiles, forming
            the white part. Traces of it are also found in the various organs of
            the body. It is likewise a common constituent, either as the free
            acid or as a urate, of urinary or renal calculi and of the so-called
            gouty concretions. From acid urines, uric acid is frequently
            deposited, on standing in a cool place, in the form of a reddish
            yellow sediment, nearly always crystalline. Chemically, it is
            composed of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, C5H4N4O3, and by
            decomposition yields urea, among other products. It can be made
            synthetically by heating together urea and glycocoll. It was formerly
            called also lithic acid, in allusion to its occurrence in stone, or
            calculus.</p>

            <p>Defn: A part or decoration of the breastplate of the high priest
            among the ancient Jews, by which Jehovah revealed his will on certain
            occasions. Its nature has been the subject of conflicting
            conjectures.
            Thou shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the
            Thummim. Ex. xxviii. 30.
            And when Saul inquired of the Lord, the Lord answered him not,
            neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets. 1 Sam. xxviii. 6.</p>
            <p>Note: Professor Plumptre supposes the Urim to have been a clear and
            colorless stone set in the breastplate of the high priest as a symbol
            of light, answering to the mystic scarab in the pectoral plate of the
            ancient Egyptian priests, and that the Thummim was an image
            corresponding to that worn by the priestly judges of Egypt as a
            symbol of truth and purity of motive. By gazing steadfastly on these,
            he may have been thrown into a mysterious, half ecstatic state, akin
            to hypnotism, in which he lost all personal consciousness, and
            received a spiritual illumination and insight.</p>

            <p>1. The act of using; mode of using or treating; treatment; conduct
            with respect to a person or a thing; as, good usage; ill usage; hard

            good usage and great liberty. Shak.</p>
            <p>2. Manners; conduct; behavior. [Obs.]

            <p>Syn.
             — Custom; use; habit.
             — Usage, Custom. These words, as here compared, agree in expressing
            the idea of habitual practice; but a custom is not necessarily a
            usage. A custom may belong to many, or to a single individual. A
            usage properly belongs to the great body of a people. Hence, we speak
            of usage, not of custom, as the law of language. Again, a custom is
            merely that which has been often repeated, so as to have become, in a
            good degree, established. A usage must be both often repeated and of
            long standing. Hence, we speak of a "hew custom," but not of a "new
            usage." Thus, also, the "customs of society" is not so strong an
            expression as the "usages of society." "Custom, a greater power than
            nature, seldom fails to make them worship." Locke. "Of things once
            received and confirmed by use, long usage is a law sufficient."
            Hooker. In law, the words usage and custom are often used
            interchangeably, but the word custom also has a technical and
            restricted sense. See Custom, n., 3.</p>

            <p>1. To make use of; to convert to one's service; to avail one's self
            of; to employ; to put a purpose; as, to use a plow; to use a chair;

            <p>Syn.
             — Employ.
             — Use, Employ. We use a thing, or make use of it, when we derive
            from it some enjoyment or service. We employ it when we turn that
            service into a particular channel. We use words to express our
            general meaning; we employ certain technical terms in reference to a
            given subject. To make use of, implies passivity in the thing; as, to
            make use of a pen; and hence there is often a material difference
            between the two words when applied to persons. To speak of "making
            use of another" generally implies a degrading idea, as if we had used
            him as a tool; while employ has no such sense. A confidential friend
            is employed to negotiate; an inferior agent is made use of on an
            intrigue.
            I would, my son, that thou wouldst use the power Which thy discretion
            gives thee, to control And manage all. Cowper.

            perfect joy. Dryden.</p>

            Use, v. i.
            </p>
            <p>1. To be wont or accustomed; to be in the habit or practice; as, he
            used to ride daily; — now disused in the present tense, perhaps
            because of the similarity in sound, between "use to," and "used to."
            They use to place him that shall be their captain on a stone.
            Spenser.
            Fears use to be represented in an imaginary. Bacon.
            Thus we use to say, it is the room that smokes, when indeed it is the

             — Fruitless; ineffectual.
             — Useless, Fruitless, Ineffectual. We speak of an attempt, effort,
            etc., as being useless when there are in it inherent difficulties
            which forbid the hope of success, as fruitless when it fails, not
            from any such difficulties, but from some unexpected hindrance
            arising to frustrate it; as, the design was rendered fruitless by the
            death of its projector. Ineffectual nearly resembles fruitless, but
            implies a failure of a less hopeless character; as, after several
            ineffectual efforts, I at last succeeded.

            <p>USURY
            U"su*ry, n. Etym: [OE. usurie, usure, F. usure, L. usura use, usury,
            interest, fr. uti, p. p. usus, to use. See Use, v. t.]</p>
            <p>1. A premium or increase paid, or stipulated to be paid, for a loan,
            as of money; interest. [Obs. or Archaic]
            Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury
            of victuals, usury of anything that is lent upon usury. Deut. xxiii.
            19.
            Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchanges, and
            then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury. Matt.

            <p>3. (Law)</p>
            <p>Defn: Interest in excess of a legal rate charged to a borrower for
            the use of money.</p>
            <p>Note: The practice of requiring in repayment of money lent anything
            more than the amount lent, was formerly thought to be a great moral
            wrong, and the greater, the more was taken. Now it is not deemed more
            wrong to take pay for the use of money than for the use of a house,
            or a horse, or any other property. But the lingering influence of the
            former opinion, together with the fact that the nature of money makes
            it easier for the lender to oppress the borrower, has caused nearly
            all Christian nations to fix by law the rate of compensation for the
            use of money. Of late years, however, the opinion that money should
            be borrowed and repaid, or bought and sold, upon whatever terms the
            parties should agree to, like any other property, has gained ground
            everywhere. Am. Cyc.</p>

            <p>Defn: One who holds the doctrine of utilitarianism.
            The utilitarians are for merging all the particular virtues into one,
            and would substitute in their place the greatest usefulness, as the

            actions should be referred. Chalmers.

            <p>Syn.
             — Usefulness; advantageous; benefit; profit; avail; service.
             — Utility, Usefulness. Usefulness has an Anglo-Saxon prefix,
            utility is Latin; and hence the former is used chiefly of things in
            the concrete, while the latter is employed more in a general and
            abstract sense. Thus, we speak of the utility of an invention, and
            the usefulness of the thing invented; of the utility of an
            institution, and the usefulness of an individual. So beauty and
            utility (not usefulness) are brought into comparison. Still, the
            words are often used interchangeably.</p>
