            <h2><a id="chap17"></a>Q</h2>
            <p>Defn: , the seventeenth letter of the English alphabet, has but one
            sound (that of k), and is always followed by u, the two letters
            together being sounded like kw, except in some words in which the u
            is silent. See Guide to Pronunciation, § 249. Q is not found in
            Anglo-Saxon, cw being used instead of qu; as in cwic, quick; cwen,
            queen. The name (ku) is from the French ku, which is from the Latin
            name of the same letter; its form is from the Latin, which derived
            it, through a Greek alphabet, from the Phoenician, the ultimate
            origin being Egyptian. Etymologically, q or qu is most nearly related
            to a (ch, tch), p, q, and wh; as in cud, quid, L. equus, ecus, horse,
            Gr. equine, hippic; L. quod which, E. what; L. aquila, E. eaqle; E.

             — Quaint, Odd, Antique. Antique is applied to that which has come
            down from the ancients, or which is made to imitate some ancient work
            of art. Odd implies disharmony, incongruity, or unevenness. An odd
            thing or person is an exception to general rules of calculation and
            procedure, or expectation and common experience. In the current use
            of quaint, the two ideas of odd and antique are combined, and the
            word is commonly applied to that which is pleasing by reason of both
            these qualities. Thus, we speak of the quaint architecture of many
            old buildings in London; or a quaint expression, uniting at once the
            antique and the fanciful.</p>

            <p>6. Talk; conversation; speech; speech.[Obs.] Shak. In question, in
            debate; in the course of examination or discussion; as, the matter or
            point in question.
             — Leading question. See under Leading.
             — Out of question, unquestionably. "Out of question, 't is Maria's
            hand." Shak.

             — Previous question, a question put to a parliamentary assembly
            upon the motion of a member, in order to ascertain whether it is the
            will of the body to vote at once, without further debate, on the
            subject under consideration.</p>
            <p>Note: The form of the question is: "Shall the main question be now
            put" If the vote is in the affirmative, the matter before the body
            must be voted upon as it then stands, without further general debate
            or the submission of new amendments. In the House of Representatives
            of the United States, and generally in America, a negative decision
            operates to keep the business before the body as if the motion had
            not been made; but in the English Parliament, it operates to postpone
            consideration for the day, and until the subject may be again
            introduced. In American practice, the object of the motion is to
            hasten action, and it is made by a friend of the measure. In English
            practice, the object is to get rid of the subject for the time being,
            and the motion is made with a purpose of voting against it. Cushing.
             — To beg the question. See under Beg.
             — To the question, to the point in dispute; to the real matter
            under debate.</p>

            distrust or opposition on the part of the questioner.</p>
