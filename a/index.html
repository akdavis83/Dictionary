    <h2><a id="chap01"></a>A<br>
    A (named a in the English, and most commonly ä in other languages).</h2>
    <p>Defn: The first letter of the English and of many other alphabets.
    The capital A of the alphabets of Middle and Western Europe, as also
    the small letter (a), besides the forms in Italic, black letter,
    etc., are all descended from the old Latin A, which was borrowed from
    the Greek Alpha, of the same form; and this was made from the first
    letter (Aleph, and itself from the Egyptian origin. The Aleph was a
    consonant letter, with a guttural breath sound that was not an
    element of Greek articulation; and the Greeks took it to represent
    their vowel Alpha with the ä sound, the Phoenician alphabet having no
    vowel symbols. This letter, in English, is used for several different
    vowel sounds. See Guide to pronunciation, §§ 43-74. The regular long
    a, as in fate, etc., is a comparatively modern sound, and has taken
    the place of what, till about the early part of the 17th century, was
    a sound of the quality of ä (as in far).</p>
    <p>2. (Mus.)</p>
    <p>Defn: The name of the sixth tone in the model major scale (that in<br>
    C), or the first tone of the minor scale, which is named after it the<br>
    scale in A minor. The second string of the violin is tuned to the A<br>
    in the treble staff.<br>
     — A sharp (A#) is the name of a musical tone intermediate between A<br>
    and B.<br>
     — A flat (A) is the name of a tone intermediate between A and G.
    </p>
    <p>A per se Etym: (L. per se by itself), one preëminent; a nonesuch.<br>
    [Obs.]<br>
    O fair Creseide, the flower and A per se Of Troy and Greece. Chaucer.
    </p>
    <p>A<br>
    A (# emph. #).
    </p>
    <p>1. Etym: [Shortened form of an. AS. an one. See One.]</p>
    <p>Defn: An adjective, commonly called the indefinite article, and
    signifying one or any, but less emphatically.</p>
    <p>Defn: "At a birth"; "In a word"; "At a blow". Shak.</p>
    <p>Note: It is placed before nouns of the singular number denoting an
    individual object, or a quality individualized, before collective
    nouns, and also before plural nouns when the adjective few or the
    phrase great many or good many is interposed; as, a dog, a house, a
    man; a color; a sweetness; a hundred, a fleet, a regiment; a few
    persons, a great many days. It is used for an, for the sake of
    euphony, before words beginning with a consonant sound [for exception
    of certain words beginning with h, see An]; as, a table, a woman, a
    year, a unit, a eulogy, a ewe, a oneness, such a one, etc. Formally
    an was used both before vowels and consonants.</p>
    <p>2. Etym: [Originally the preposition a (an, on).]</p>
    <p>Defn: In each; to or for each; as, "twenty leagues a day", "a hundred
    pounds a year", "a dollar a yard", etc.</p>
    <p>A<br>
    A, prep. Etym: [Abbreviated form of an (AS. on). See On.]
    </p>
    <p>1. In; on; at; by. [Obs.] "A God's name." "Torn a pieces." "Stand a
    tiptoe." "A Sundays" Shak. "Wit that men have now a days." Chaucer.
    "Set them a work." Robynson (More's Utopia)</p>
    <p>2. In process of; in the act of; into; to; — used with verbal
    substantives in -ing which begin with a consonant. This is a
    shortened form of the preposition an (which was used before the vowel
    sound); as in a hunting, a building, a begging. "Jacob, when he was a
    dying" Heb. xi. 21. "We'll a birding together." " It was a doing."
    Shak. "He burst out a laughing." Macaulay. The hyphen may be used to
    connect a with the verbal substantive (as, a-hunting, a-building) or
    the words may be written separately. This form of expression is now
    for the most part obsolete, the a being omitted and the verbal
    substantive treated as a participle.</p>
    <p>A<br>
    A. Etym: [From AS. of off, from. See Of.]
    </p>

    <p>Defn: An expletive, void of sense, to fill up the meter<br>
    A merry heart goes all the day, Your sad tires in a mile-a. Shak.
    </p>
    <h5>A-
    A-</h5>
    <p>Defn: A, as a prefix to English words, is derived from various
    sources. (1) It frequently signifies on or in (from an, a forms of
    AS. on), denoting a state, as in afoot, on foot, abed, amiss, asleep,
    aground, aloft, away (AS. onweg), and analogically, ablaze, atremble,
    etc. (2) AS. of off, from, as in adown (AS. ofdüne off the dun or
    hill). (3) AS. a- (Goth. us-, ur-, Ger. er-), usually giving an
    intensive force, and sometimes the sense of away, on, back, as in
    arise, abide, ago. (4) Old English y- or i- (corrupted from the AS.
    inseparable particle ge-, cognate with OHG. ga-, gi-, Goth. ga-),
    which, as a prefix, made no essential addition to the meaning, as in
    aware. (5) French à (L. ad to), as in abase, achieve. (6) L. a, ab,
    abs, from, as in avert. (7) Greek insep. prefix a without, or
    privative, not, as in abyss, atheist; akin to E. un-.</p>

    takes its origin.</p>

     — To give up; yield; forego; cede; surrender; resign; abdicate;

    from.
     — To Abandon, Desert, Forsake. These words agree in representing a
    person as giving up or leaving some object, but differ as to the mode
    of doing it. The distinctive sense of abandon is that of giving up a
    thing absolutely and finally; as, to abandon one's friends, places,
    opinions, good or evil habits, a hopeless enterprise, a shipwrecked
    vessel. Abandon is more widely applicable than forsake or desert. The
    Latin original of desert appears to have been originally applied to
    the case of deserters from military service. Hence, the verb, when
    used of persons in the active voice, has usually or always a bad
    sense, implying some breach of fidelity, honor, etc., the leaving of
    something which the person should rightfully stand by and support;
    as, to desert one's colors, to desert one's post, to desert one's
    principles or duty. When used in the passive, the sense is not
    necessarily bad; as, the fields were deserted, a deserted village,
    deserted halls. Forsake implies the breaking off of previous habit,
    association, personal connection, or that the thing left had been
    familiar or frequented; as, to forsake old friends, to forsake the
    paths of rectitude, the blood forsook his cheeks. It may be used
    either in a good or in a bad sense.</p>
    <p>ABANDON<br>

    </p>
    <p>Defn: Abandonment; relinquishment. [Obs.]</p>

    A`ban`don", n. Etym: [F. See Abandon.]

    <p>ABANDONED<br>
    A*ban"doned, a.
    </p>
    <p>1. Forsaken, deserted. "Your abandoned streams." Thomson.</p>
    <p>2. Self-abandoned, or given up to vice; extremely wicked, or sinning
    without restraint; irreclaimably wicked ; as, an abandoned villain.</p>
    <p>Syn.
     — Profligate; dissolute; corrupt; vicious; depraved; reprobate;
    wicked; unprincipled; graceless; vile.
     — Abandoned, Profligate, Reprobate. These adjectives agree in
    expressing the idea of great personal depravity. Profligate has
    reference to open and shameless immoralities, either in private life
    or political conduct; as, a profligate court, a profligate ministry.
    Abandoned is stronger, and has reference to the searing of conscience
    and hardening of heart produced by a man's giving himself wholly up
    to iniquity; as, a man of abandoned character. Reprobate describes
    the condition of one who has become insensible to reproof, and who is
    morally abandoned and lost beyond hope of recovery.
    God gave them over to a reprobate mind. Rom. i. 28.</p>

    Whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased. Luke xiv. ll.</p>
    <p>Syn.
     — To Abase, Debase, Degrade. These words agree in the idea of
    bringing down from a higher to a lower state. Abase has reference to
    a bringing down in condition or feelings; as to abase one's self
    before God. Debase has reference to the bringing down of a thing in
    purity, or making it base. It is, therefore, always used in a bad
    sense, as, to debase the coin of the kingdom, to debase the mind by
    vicious indulgence, to debase one's style by coarse or vulgar
    expressions. Degrade has reference to a bringing down from some
    higher grade or from some standard. Thus, a priest is degraded from
    the clerical office. When used in a moral sense, it denotes a
    bringing down in character and just estimation; as, degraded by
    intemperance, a degrading employment, etc. "Art is degraded when it
    is regarded only as a trade."</p>

    </p>
    <p>Defn: To destroy the self-possession of; to confuse or confound, as
    by exciting suddenly a consciousness of guilt, mistake, or
    inferiority; to put to shame; to disconcert; to discomfit.
    Abashed, the devil stood, And felt how awful goodness is. Milton.
    He was a man whom no check could abash. Macaulay.</p>
    <p>Syn.
     — To confuse; confound; disconcert; shame.
     — To Abash, Confuse, Confound. Abash is a stronger word than
    confuse, but not so strong as confound. We are abashed when struck
    either with sudden shame or with a humbling sense of inferiority; as,
    Peter was abashed in the presence of those who are greatly his
    superiors. We are confused when, from some unexpected or startling
    occurrence, we lose clearness of thought and self-possession. Thus, a
    witness is often confused by a severe cross-examination; a timid
    person is apt to be confused in entering a room full of strangers. We
    are confounded when our minds are overwhelmed, as it were, by
    something wholly unexpected, amazing, dreadful, etc., so that we have
    nothing to say. Thus, a criminal is usually confounded at the
    discovery of his guilt.
    Satan stood Awhile as mute, confounded what to say. Milton.</p>

    A*bate", v.t. [imp.&amp; p.p. Abated, p.pr. &amp; vb.n. Abating.] Etym: [OF.
    abatre to beat down, F. abattre, LL. abatere; ab or ad + batere,
    battere (popular form for L. batuere to beat). Cf. Bate, Batter.]</p>
    <p>1. To beat down; to overthrow. [Obs.]

    <p>4. To blunt. [Obs.]
    To abate the edge of envy. Bacon.</p>
    <p>5. To reduce in estimation; to deprive. [Obs.]
    She hath abated me of half my train. Shak.</p>
    <p>6. (Law)</p>
    <p>Defn: (a) To bring entirely down or put an end to; to do away with;
    as, to abate a nuisance, to abate a writ. (b) (Eng. Law) To diminish;
    to reduce. Legacies are liable to be abated entirely or in
    proportion, upon a deficiency of assets. To abate a tax, to remit it
    either wholly or in part.</p>
    <p>ABATE<br>
    A*bate", v.i. Etym: [See Abate, v.t.]
    </p>
    <p>1. To decrease, or become less in strength or violence; as, pain
    abates, a storm abates.
    The fury of Glengarry . . . rapidly abated. Macaulay.</p>
    <p>2. To be defeated, or come to naught; to fall through; to fail; as, a
    writ abates. To abate into a freehold, To abate in lands (Law), to
    enter into a freehold after the death of the last possessor, and
    before the heir takes possession. See Abatement, 4.</p>
    <p>Syn.
     — To subside; decrease; intermit; decline; diminish; lessen.
     — To Abate, Subside. These words, as here compared, imply a coming
    down from some previously raised or exited state. Abate expresses
    this in respect to degrees, and implies a diminution of force or of
    intensity; as, the storm abates, the cold abates, the force of the
    wind abates; or, the wind abates, a fever abates. Subside (to settle
    down) has reference to a previous state of agitation or commotion;
    as, the waves subside after a storm, the wind subsides into a calm.
    When the words are used figuratively, the same distinction should be
    observed. If we conceive of a thing as having different degrees of
    intensity or strength, the word to be used is abate. Thus we say, a
    man's anger abates, the ardor of one's love abates, "Winter rage
    abates". But if the image be that of a sinking down into quiet from
    preceding excitement or commotion, the word to be used is subside;
    as, the tumult of the people subsides, the public mind subsided into
    a calm. The same is the case with those emotions which are tumultuous
    in their nature; as, his passion subsides, his joy quickly subsided,
    his grief subsided into a pleasing melancholy. Yet if, in such cases,
    we were thinking of the degree of violence of the emotion, we might
    use abate; as, his joy will abate in the progress of time; and so in
    other instances.</p>

     — To Abdicate, Resign. Abdicate commonly expresses the act of a
    monarch in voluntary and formally yielding up sovereign authority;
    as, to abdicate the government. Resign is applied to the act of any
    person, high or low, who gives back an office or trust into the hands
    of him who conferred it. Thus, a minister resigns, a military officer
    resigns, a clerk resigns. The expression, "The king resigned his
    crown," sometimes occurs in our later literature, implying that he
    held it from his people.
     — There are other senses of resign which are not here brought into
    view.</p>

    Natural abilities are like natural plants, that need pruning by

    Macaulay.</p>
    <p>Syn.
     — Capacity; talent; cleverness; faculty; capability; efficiency;
    aptitude; aptness; address; dexterity; skill. Ability, Capacity.
    These words come into comparison when applied to the higher
    intellectual powers. Ability has reference to the active exercise of
    our faculties. It implies not only native vigor of mind, but that
    ease and promptitude of execution which arise from mental training.
    Thus, we speak of the ability with which a book is written, an
    argument maintained, a negotiation carried on, etc. It always
    something to be done, and the power of doing it. Capacity has
    reference to the receptive powers. In its higher exercises it
    supposes great quickness of apprehension and breadth of intellect,
    with an uncommon aptitude for acquiring and retaining knowledge.
    Hence it carries with it the idea of resources and undeveloped power.
    Thus we speak of the extraordinary capacity of such men as Lord
    Bacon, Blaise Pascal, and Edmund Burke. "Capacity," says H. Taylor,
    "is requisite to devise, and ability to execute, a great enterprise."
    The word abilities, in the plural, embraces both these qualities, and
    denotes high mental endowments.</p>

    <p>Syn.
     — To Abolish, Repeal, Abrogate, Revoke, Annul, Nullify, Cancel.
    These words have in common the idea of setting aside by some
    overruling act. Abolish applies particularly to things of a permanent
    nature, such as institutions, usages, customs, etc.; as, to abolish
    monopolies, serfdom, slavery. Repeal describes the act by which the
    legislature of a state sets aside a law which it had previously
    enacted. Abrogate was originally applied to the repeal of a law by
    the Roman people; and hence, when the power of making laws was
    usurped by the emperors, the term was applied to their act of setting
    aside the laws. Thus it came to express that act by which a sovereign
    or an executive government sets aside laws, ordinances, regulations,
    treaties, conventions, etc. Revoke denotes the act or recalling some
    previous grant which conferred, privilege, etc.; as, to revoke a
    decree, to revoke a power of attorney, a promise, etc. Thus, also, we
    speak of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Annul is used in a
    more general sense, denoting simply to make void; as, to annul a
    contract, to annul an agreement. Nullify is an old word revived in
    this country, and applied to the setting of things aside either by
    force or by total disregard; as, to nullify an act of Congress.
    Cancel is to strike out or annul, by a deliberate exercise of power,
    something which has operative force.</p>

    <p>Defn: One of the elements of reference by which a point, as of a
    curve, is referred to a system of fixed rectilineal coördinate axes.</p>
    <p>Note: When referred to two intersecting axes, one of them called the
    axis of abscissas, or of X, and the other the axis of ordinates, or
    of Y, the abscissa of the point is the distance cut off from the axis
    of X by a line drawn through it and parallel to the axis of Y. When a
    point in space is referred to three axes having a common
    intersection, the abscissa may be the distance measured parallel to
    either of them, from the point to the plane of the other two axes.
    Abscissas and ordinates taken together are called coördinates.
     — OX or PY is the abscissa of the point P of the curve, OY or PX
    its ordinate, the intersecting lines OX and OY being the axes of
    abscissas and ordinates respectively, and the point O their origin.</p>

     — Absent, Abstracted. These words both imply a want of attention to
    surrounding objects. We speak of a man as absent when his thoughts
    wander unconsciously from present scenes or topics of discourse; we
    speak of him as abstracted when his mind (usually for a brief period)
    is drawn off from present things by some weighty matter for
    reflection. Absence of mind is usually the result of loose habits of
    thought; abstraction commonly arises either from engrossing interests
    and cares, or from unfortunate habits of association.</p>

    the human intellect.

    moral acquittal. We speak of a person as acquitted, when a decision

     — To Absorb, Engross, Swallow up, Engulf. These words agree in one
    general idea, that of completely taking up. They are chiefly used in
    a figurative sense and may be distinguished by a reference to their
    etymology. We speak of a person as absorbed (lit., drawn in,
    swallowed up) in study or some other employment of the highest
    interest. We speak of a person as ebgrossed (lit., seized upon in the
    gross, or wholly) by something which occupies his whole time and
    thoughts, as the acquisition of wealth, or the attainment of honor.
    We speak of a person (under a stronger image) as swallowed up and
    lost in that which completely occupies his thoughts and feelings, as
    in grief at the death of a friend, or in the multiplied cares of
    life. We speak of a person as engulfed in that which (like a gulf)
    takes in all his hopes and interests; as, engulfed in misery, ruin,
    etc.

    <p>1. Withdraw; separate. [Obs.]
    The more abstract . . . we are from the body. Norris.</p>
    <p>2. Considered apart from any application to a particular object;
    separated from matter; exiting in the mind only; as, abstract truth,

    (b) Resulting from the mental faculty of abstraction; general as
    opposed to particular; as, "reptile" is an abstract or general name.
    Locke.
    A concrete name is a name which stands for a thing; an abstract name
    which stands for an attribute of a thing. A practice has grown up in
    more modern times, which, if not introduced by Locke, has gained
    currency from his example, of applying the expression "abstract name"
    to all names which are the result of abstraction and generalization,
    and consequently to all general names, instead of confining it to the
    names of attributes. J. S. Mill.</p>
    <p>4. Abstracted; absent in mind. "Abstract, as in a trance." Milton. An

     — Abstract numbers (Math.), numbers used without application to
    things, as 6, 8, 10; but when applied to any thing, as 6 feet, 10
    men, they become concrete.
     — Abstract or Pure mathematics. See Mathematics.</p>

    <p>Defn: The act process of leaving out of consideration one or more
    properties of a complex object so as to attend to others; analysis.
    Thus, when the mind considers the form of a tree by itself, or the
    color of the leaves as separate from their size or figure, the act is
    called abstraction. So, also, when it considers whiteness, softness,
    virtue, existence, as separate from any particular objects.</p>
    <p>Note: Abstraction is necessary to classification, by which things are
    arranged in genera and species. We separate in idea the qualities of
    certain objects, which are of the same kind, from others which are
    different, in each, and arrange the objects having the same
    properties in a class, or collected body.

    whose aliquot parts are 1, 2, 7, the sum of which is 10; and to a

    as it were, into some regular course of things, but is secondary, and
    forms no essential part thereof; as, an incremental remark, an

    fortuitous concourse of atoms. We call a thing contingent when it is
    such that, considered in itself, it may or may not happen, but is
    dependent for its existence on something else; as, the time of my
    coming will be contingent on intelligence yet to be received.</p>

    of vegetable blue or violet colors. They are also characterized by
    the power of destroying the distinctive properties of alkalies or
    bases, combining with them to form salts, at the same time losing
    their own peculiar properties. They all contain hydrogen, united with
    a more negative element or radical, either alone, or more generally
    with oxygen, and take their names from this negative element or
    radical. Those which contain no oxygen are sometimes called hydracids
    in distinction from the others which are called oxygen acids or
    oxacids.</p>

    respectively sulphur acids or sulphacids, selenium acids, or
    tellurium acids. When the hydrogen of an acid is replaced by a
    positive element or radical, a salt is formed, and hence acids are
    sometimes named as salts of hydrogen; as hydrogen nitrate for nitric
    acid, hydrogen sulphate for sulphuric acid, etc. In the old chemistry

    occasional intercourse; as, our acquaintance has been a brief one. We

    frequently together, so as to wear off all restraint and reserve; as,
    the familiarity of old companions. Intimacy is the result of close
    connection, and the freest interchange of thought; as, the intimacy
    of established friendship.

    with him. Addison.

    <p>3. The court which has jurisdiction of maritime questions and
    offenses.</p>
    <p>Note: In England, admiralty jurisdiction was formerly vested in the
    High Court of Admiralty, which was held before the Lord High Admiral,
    or his deputy, styled the Judge of the Admiralty; but admiralty
    jurisdiction is now vested in the probate, divorce, and admiralty
    division of the High Justice. In America, there are no admiralty
    courts distinct from others, but admiralty jurisdiction is vested in
    the district courts of the United States, subject to revision by the
    circuit courts and the Supreme Court of the United States. Admiralty
    jurisprudence has cognizance of maritime contracts and torts,
    collisions at sea, cases of prize in war, etc., and in America,
    admiralty jurisdiction is extended to such matters, arising out of
    the navigation of any of the public waters, as the Great Lakes and
    rivers.</p>
    <p>4. The system of jurisprudence of admiralty courts.</p>
    <p>5. The building in which the lords of the admiralty, in England,

    <p>Syn.
     — Admission; access; entrance; initiation.
     — Admittance, Admission. These words are, to some extent, in a
    state of transition and change. Admittance is now chiefly confined to
    its primary sense of access into some locality or building. Thus we
    see on the doors of factories, shops, etc. "No admittance." Its
    secondary or moral sense, as "admittance to the church," is almost
    entirely laid aside. Admission has taken to itself the secondary or
    figurative senses; as, admission to the rights of citizenship;
    admission to the church; the admissions made by one of the parties in
    a dispute. And even when used in its primary sense, it is not
    identical with admittance. Thus, we speak of admission into a
    country, territory, and other larger localities, etc., where
    admittance could not be used. So, when we speak of admission to a
    concert or other public assembly, the meaning is not perhaps exactly
    that of admittance, viz., access within the walls of the building,
    but rather a reception into the audience, or access to the
    performances. But the lines of distinction on this subject are one
    definitely drawn.</p>

    <p>Syn.
     — Admonition, Reprehension, Reproof. Admonition is prospective, and
    relates to moral delinquencies; its object is to prevent further
    transgression. Reprehension and reproof are retrospective, the former
    being milder than the latter. A person of any age or station may be
    liable to reprehension in case of wrong conduct; but reproof is the
    act of a superior. It is authoritative fault-finding or censure
    addressed to children or to inferiors.</p>

    A*dorn", v. t. [imp. &amp; p. p. Adorned; p. pr. &amp; vb. n. Adorning.]<br>
    Etym: [OE. aournen, anournen, adornen, OF. aorner, fr. L. aaornare;<br>
    ad + ornare to furnish, embellish. See Adore, Ornate.]
    </p>
    <p>Defn: To deck or dress with ornaments; to embellish; to set off to
    advantage; to render pleasing or attractive.
    As a bride adorneth herself with her jewels. Isa. lxi. 10.
    At church, with meek and unaffected grace, His looks adorned the
    venerable place. Goldsmith.</p>
    <p>Syn.
     — To deck; decorate; embellish; ornament; beautify; grace; dignify;
    exalt; honor.
     — To Adorn, Ornament, Decorate, Embellish. We decorate and ornament
    by putting on some adjunct which is attractive or beautiful, and
    which serves to heighten the general effect. Thus, a lady's head-
    dress may be ornament or decorated with flowers or jewelry; a hall
    may be decorated or ornament with carving or gilding, with wreaths of
    flowers, or with hangings. Ornament is used in a wider sense than
    decorate. To embellish is to beautify or ornament richly, not so much
    by mere additions or details as by modifying the thing itself as a
    whole. It sometimes means gaudy and artificial decoration. We
    embellish a book with rich engravings; a style is embellished with
    rich and beautiful imagery; a shopkeeper embellishes his front window
    to attract attention. Adorn is sometimes identical with decorate, as
    when we say, a lady was adorned with jewels. In other cases, it seems
    to imply something more. Thus, we speak of a gallery of paintings as
    adorned with the works of some of the great masters, or adorned with
    noble statuary and columns. Here decorated and ornamented would
    hardly be appropriate. There is a value in these works of genius
    beyond mere show and ornament. Adorn may be used of what is purely
    moral; as, a character adorned with every Christian grace. Here
    neither decorate, nor ornament, nor embellish is proper.</p>

    <p>1. The cause of continued pain of body or mind, as sickness, losses,
    etc.; an instance of grievous distress; a pain or grief.
    To repay that money will be a biting affliction. Shak.</p>
    <p>2. The state of being afflicted; a state of pain, distress, or grief.
    Some virtues are seen only in affliction. Addison.</p>
    <p>Syn.
     — Calamity; sorrow; distress; grief; pain; adversity; misery;
    wretchedness; misfortune; trouble; hardship.
     — Affliction, Sorrow, Grief, Distress. Affliction and sorrow are
    terms of wide and general application; grief and distress have
    reference to particular cases. Affliction is the stronger term. The
    suffering lies deeper in the soul, and usually arises from some
    powerful cause, such as the loss of what is most dear — friends,
    health, etc. We do not speak of mere sickness or pain as "an
    affliction," though one who suffers from either is said to be
    afflicted; but deprivations of every kind, such as deafness,
    blindness, loss of limbs, etc., are called afflictions, showing that
    term applies particularly to prolonged sources of suffering. Sorrow
    and grief are much alike in meaning, but grief is the stronger term
    of the two, usually denoting poignant mental suffering for some
    definite cause, as, grief for the death of a dear friend; sorrow is
    more reflective, and is tinged with regret, as, the misconduct of a
    child is looked upon with sorrow. Grief is often violent and
    demonstrative; sorrow deep and brooding. Distress implies extreme
    suffering, either bodily or mental. In its higher stages, it denotes
    pain of a restless, agitating kind, and almost always supposes some
    struggle of mind or body. Affliction is allayed, grief subsides,
    sorrow is soothed, distress is mitigated.</p>

     — Alarm, Fright, Terror, Consternation. These words express
    different degrees of fear at the approach of danger. Fright is fear
    suddenly excited, producing confusion of the senses, and hence it is
    unreflecting. Alarm is the hurried agitation of feeling which springs
    from a sense of immediate and extreme exposure. Terror is agitating
    and excessive fear, which usually benumbs the faculties.
    Consternation is overwhelming fear, and carries a notion of
    powerlessness and amazement. Alarm agitates the feelings; terror
    disorders the understanding and affects the will; fright seizes on
    and confuses the sense; consternation takes possession of the soul,
    and subdues its faculties. See Apprehension.</p>

    mainly soda with a smaller amount of potash, and usually a little
    lime and  magnesia. Two main classes of alkali are commonly
    distinguished: black alkali, which may be any alkaline carbonate, but
    which practically consists of sodium carbonate (sal soda), which is
    highly corrosive and destructive to vegetation; and white alkali,
    characterized by the presence of sodium sulphate (Glauber's salt),
    which is less injurious to vegetation. Black alkali is so called
    because water containing it dissolves humus, forming a dark-colored
    solution which, when it collects in puddles and evaporates, produces
    characteristic black spots.</p>

    of them also contain oxygen. They include many of the active
    principles in plants; thus, morphine and narcotine are alkaloids
    found in opium.</p>

    Goth. alls; and perh. to Ir. and Gael. uile, W. oll.]
    </p>
    <p>1. The whole quantity, extent, duration, amount, quality, or degree
    of; the whole; the whole number of; any whatever; every; as, all the
    wheat; all the land; all the year; all the strength; all happiness;
    all abundance; loss of all power; beyond all doubt; you will see us
    all (or all of us).
    Prove all things: hold fast that which is good. 1 Thess. v. 21.</p>
    <p>2. Any. [Obs.] "Without all remedy." Shak.</p>
    <p>Note: When the definite article "the," or a possessive or a
    demonstrative pronoun, is joined to the noun that all qualifies, all
    precedes the article or the pronoun; as, all the cattle; all my
    labor; all his wealth; all our families; all your citizens; all their
    property; all other joys.</p>
    <p>Note: This word, not only in popular language, but in the Scriptures,
    often signifies, indefinitely, a large portion or number, or a great
    part. Thus, all the cattle in Egypt died, all Judea and all the
    region round about Jordan, all men held John as a prophet, are not to
    be understood in a literal sense, but as including a large part, or
    very great numbers.</p>
    <p>3. Only; alone; nothing but.<br>
    I was born to speak all mirth and no matter. Shak.<br>
    All the whole, the whole (emphatically). [Obs.] "All the whole army."<br>

    bedewed; my friend is all for amusement. "And cheeks all pale."
    Byron.</p>
    <p>Note: In the ancient phrases, all too dear, all too much, all so
    long, etc., this word retains its appropriate sense or becomes
    intensive.</p>
    <p>2. Even; just. (Often a mere intensive adjunct.) [Obs. or Poet.]
    All as his straying flock he fed. Spenser.
    A damsel lay deploring All on a rock reclined. Gay.
    All to, or All-to. In such phrases as "all to rent," "all to break,"
    "all-to frozen," etc., which are of frequent occurrence in our old
    authors, the all and the to have commonly been regarded as forming a
    compound adverb, equivalent in meaning to entirely, completely,
    altogether. But the sense of entireness lies wholly in the word all
    (as it does in "all forlorn," and similar expressions), and the to
    properly belongs to the following word, being a kind of intensive
    prefix (orig. meaning asunder and answering to the LG. ter-, HG. zer-
    ). It is frequently to be met with in old books, used without the
    all. Thus Wyclif says, "The vail of the temple was to rent:" and of
    Judas, "He was hanged and to-burst the middle:" i. e., burst in two,
    or asunder.

    [Low] — All one, the same thing in effect; that is, wholly the same
    thing.
     — All over, over the whole extent; thoroughly; wholly; as, she is
    her mother all over. [Colloq.] — All the better, wholly the better;
    that is, better by the whole difference.
     — All the same, nevertheless. "There they [certain phenomena]
    remain rooted all the same, whether we recognize them or not." J. C.
    Shairp. "But Rugby is a very nice place all the same." T. Arnold.
     — See also under All, n.</p>
    <p>ALL<br>
    All, n.
    </p>
    <p>Defn: The whole number, quantity, or amount; the entire thing;
    everything included or concerned; the aggregate; the whole; totality;
    everything or every person; as, our all is at stake.
    Death, as the Psalmist saith, is certain to all. Shak.
    All that thou seest is mine. Gen. xxxi. 43.</p>
    <p>Note: All is used with of, like a partitive; as, all of a thing, all
    of us. After all, after considering everything to the contrary;
    nevertheless.
     — All in all, a phrase which signifies all things to a person, or
    everything desired; (also adverbially) wholly; altogether.

    and all." Shak.
     — At all. (a) In every respect; wholly; thoroughly. [Obs.] "She is
    a shrew at al(l)." Chaucer. (b) A phrase much used by way of
    enforcement or emphasis, usually in negative or interrogative
    sentences, and signifying in any way or respect; in the least degree
    or to the least extent; in the least; under any circumstances; as, he
    has no ambition at all; has he any property at all "Nothing at all. "
    Shak. "It thy father at all miss me." 1 Sam. xx. 6.
     — Over all, everywhere. [Obs.] Chaucer.</p>
    <p>Note: All is much used in composition to enlarge the meaning, or add
    force to a word. In some instances, it is completely incorporated
    into words, and its final consonant is dropped, as in almighty,
    already, always: but, in most instances, it is an adverb prefixed to
    adjectives or participles, but usually with a hyphen, as, all-
    bountiful, all-glorious, allimportant, all-surrounding, etc. In
    others it is an adjective; as, allpower, all-giver. Anciently many
    words, as, alabout, alaground, etc., were compounded with all, which
    are now written separately.</p>

    </p>
    <p>1. The tie or obligation, implied or expressed, which a subject owes
    to his sovereign or government; the duty of fidelity to one's king,
    government, or state.</p>
    <p>2. Devotion; loyalty; as, allegiance to science.</p>
    <p>Syn.
     — Loyalty; fealty.
     — Allegiance, Loyalty. These words agree in expressing the general
    idea of fidelity and attachment to the "powers that be." Allegiance
    is an obligation to a ruling power. Loyalty is a feeling or sentiment
    towards such power. Allegiance may exist under any form of
    government, and, in a republic, we generally speak of allegiance to
    the government, to the state, etc. In well conducted monarchies,
    loyalty is a warm-hearted feeling of fidelity and obedience to the
    sovereign. It is personal in its nature; and hence we speak of the
    loyalty of a wife to her husband, not of her allegiance. In cases
    where we personify, loyalty is more commonly the word used; as,
    loyalty to the constitution; loyalty to the cause of virtue; loyalty
    to truth and religion, etc.
    Hear me, recreant, on thine allegiance hear me! Shak.
    So spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found, . . . Unshaken,
    unseduced, unterrified, His loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal.

    <p>ALLEGORY<br>
    Al"le*go*ry, n.; pl. Allegories. Etym: [L. allegoria, Gr. allégorie.]
    </p>
    <p>1. A figurative sentence or discourse, in which the principal subject
    is described by another subject resembling it in its properties and
    circumstances. The real subject is thus kept out of view, and we are
    left to collect the intentions of the writer or speaker by the
    resemblance of the secondary to the primary subject.</p>
    <p>2. Anything which represents by suggestive resemblance; an emblem.</p>
    <p>3. (Paint. &amp; Sculpt.)</p>
    <p>Defn: A figure representation which has a meaning beyond notion
    directly conveyed by the object painted or sculptured.</p>
    <p>Syn.
     — Metaphor; fable.
     — Allegory, Parable. "An allegory differs both from fable and
    parable, in that the properties of persons are fictitiously
    represented as attached to things, to which they are as it were
    transferred. . . . A figure of Peace and Victory crowning some
    historical personage is an allegory. "I am the Vine, ye are the
    branches" [John xv. 1-6] is a spoken allegory. In the parable there
    is no transference of properties. The parable of the sower [Matt.
    xiii. 3-23] represents all things as according to their proper
    nature. In the allegory quoted above the properties of the vine and
    the relation of the branches are transferred to the person of Christ
    and His apostles and disciples." C. J. Smith.</p>
    <p>Note: An allegory is a prolonged metaphor. Bunyan's "Pilgrim's
    Progress" and Spenser's "Faërie Queene" are celebrated examples of
    the allegory.</p>

    Al*le"lo*morph, n. [Gr.  of one another + Gr.  form.] (Biol.)
    </p>
    <p>Defn: One of the pure unit characters commonly existing singly or in
    pairs in the germ cells of Mendelian hybrids, and exhibited in
    varying proportion among the organisms themselves. Allelomorphs which
    under certain circumstances are themselves compound are called
    hypallelomorphs. See Mendel's law. — Al*le`lo*mor"phic (#), a.</p>
    <p>As we know that the several unit characters are of such a nature that
    any one of them is capable of independently displacing or being
    displaced by one or more alternative characters taken singly, we may
    recognize this fact by naming such characters allelomorphs.

     — To Allure, Entice, Decoy, Seduce. These words agree in the idea
    of acting upon the mind by some strong controlling influence, and

    used in a bad sense, except allure, which has sometimes (though
    rarely) a good one. We are allured by the prospect or offer (usually

    the path of rectitude. What allures draws by gentle means; what
    entices leads us by promises and persuasions; what decoys betrays us,
    as it were, into a snare or net; what seduces deceives us by artful
    appeals to the passions.</p>

    But rather famish them amid their plenty. Shak.</p>
    <p>Syn.
     — Amidst, Among. These words differ to some extent from each other,
    as will be seen from their etymology. Amidst denotes in the midst or
    middle of, and hence surrounded by; as, this work was written amidst
    many interruptions. Among denotes a mingling or intermixing with
    distinct or separable objects; as, "He fell among thieves." "Blessed
    art thou among women." Hence, we say, among the moderns, among the
    ancients, among the thickest of trees, among these considerations,
    among the reasons I have to offer. Amid and amidst are commonly used
    when the idea of separate or distinguishable objects is not
    prominent. Hence, we say, they kept on amidst the storm, amidst the
    gloom, he was sinking amidst the waves, he persevered amidst many
    difficulties; in none of which cases could among be used. In like
    manner, Milton speaks of Abdiel, —
    The seraph Abdiel, faithful found; Among the faithless faithful only
    he, because he was then considered as one of the angels. But when the
    poet adds, —
    From amidst them forth he passed, we have rather the idea of the
    angels as a collective body.

    <p>Syn.
     — Old; primitive; pristine; antique; antiquated; old-fashioned;
    obsolete.
     — Ancient, Antiquated, Obsolete, Antique, Antic, Old.
     — Ancient is opposed to modern, and has antiquity; as, an ancient
    family, ancient landmarks, ancient institutions, systems of thought,
    etc. Antiquated describes that which has gone out of use or fashion;
    as, antiquated furniture, antiquated laws, rules, etc. Obsolete is
    commonly used, instead of antiquated, in reference to language,
    customs, etc.; as, an obsolete word or phrase, an obsolete
    expression. Antique is applied, in present usage, either to that
    which has come down from the ancients; as, an antique cameo, bust,
    etc. ; or to that which is made to imitate some ancient work of art;
    as, an antique temple. In the days of Shakespeare, antique was often
    used for ancient; as, "an antique song," "an antique Roman;" and
    hence, from singularity often attached to what is ancient, it was
    used in the sense of grotesque; as, "an oak whose antique root peeps
    out; " and hence came our present word antic, denoting grotesque or
    ridiculous. We usually apply both ancient and old to things subject
    to gradual decay. We say, an old man, an ancient record; but never,
    the old stars, an old river or mountain. In general, however, ancient
    is opposed to modern, and old to new, fresh, or recent. When we speak
    of a thing that existed formerly, which has ceased to exist, we
    commonly use ancient; as, ancient republics, ancient heroes; and not
    old republics, old heroes. But when the thing which began or existed
    in former times is still in existence, we use either ancient or old;
    as, ancient statues or paintings, or old statues or paintings;
    ancient authors, or old authors, meaning books.</p>

    AS. ange oppressed, sad, L. angor a strangling, anguish, angere to

    <p>2. A strong passion or emotion of displeasure or antagonism, excited
    by a real or supposed injury or insult to one's self or others, or by

    Anger is like A full hot horse, who being allowed his way, Self-
    mettle tires him. Shak.</p>
    <p>Syn.
     — Resentment; wrath; rage; fury; passion; ire gall; choler;
    indignation; displeasure; vexation; grudge; spleen.
     — Anger, Indignation, Resentment, Wrath, Ire, Rage, Fury. Anger is
    a feeling of keen displeasure (usually with a desire to punish) for
    what we regard as wrong toward ourselves or others. It may be
    excessive or misplaced, but is not necessarily criminal. Indignation
    is a generous outburst of anger in view of things which are indigna,
    or unworthy to be done, involving what is mean, cruel, flagitious,
    etc., in character or conduct. Resentment is often a moody feeling,
    leading one to brood over his supposed personal wrongs with a deep
    and lasting anger. See Resentment. Wrath and ire (the last poetical)
    express the feelings of one who is bitterly provoked. Rage is a
    vehement ebullition of anger; and fury is an excess of rage,
    amounting almost to madness. Warmth of constitution often gives rise
    to anger; a high sense of honor creates indignation at crime; a man
    of quick sensibilities is apt to cherish resentment; the wrath and
    ire of men are often connected with a haughty and vindictive spirit;
    rage and fury are distempers of the soul to be regarded only with
    abhorrence.</p>

     — To prevent; obviate; preclude; forestall; expect.
     — To Anticipate, Expect. These words, as here compared, agree in
    regarding some future event as about to take place. Expect is the
    stringer. It supposes some ground or reason in the mind for
    considering the event as likely to happen. Anticipate is, literally,
    to take beforehand, and here denotes simply to take into the mind as
    conception of the future. Hence, to say, "I did not anticipate a
    refusal," expresses something less definite and strong than to say, "
    did not expect it." Still, anticipate is a convenient word to be
    interchanged with expect in cases where the thought will allow.
    Good with bad Expect to hear; supernal grace contending With
    sinfulness of men. Milton.
    I would not anticipate the relish of any happiness, nor feel the

    supposed actions of brutes or inanimate things, and therefore is not
    limited by strict rules of probability. Æsop's fables are good
    examples of apologues.</p>
    <p>APOLOGY<br>
    A*pol"o*gy, n.; pl. Apologies . Etym: [L. apologia, Gr. apologie. See<br>
    Apologetic.]
    </p>
    <p>1. Something said or written in defense or justification of what
    appears to others wrong, or of what may be liable to disapprobation;
    justification; as, Tertullian's Apology for Christianity.
    It is not my intention to make an apology for my poem; some will
    think it needs no excuse, and others will receive none. Dryden.</p>
    <p>2. An acknowledgment intended as an atonement for some improper or
    injurious remark or act; an admission to another of a wrong or
    discourtesy done him, accompanied by an expression of regret.</p>
    <p>3. Anything provided as a substitute; a makeshift.
    He goes to work devising apologies for window curtains. Dickens.</p>
    <p>Syn.
     — Excuse. An apology, in the original sense of the word, was a
    pleading off from some charge or imputation, by explaining and
    defending one's principles or conduct. It therefore amounted to a
    vindication. One who offers an apology, admits himself to have been,
    at least apparently, in the wrong, but brings forward some palliating
    circumstance, or tenders a frank acknowledgment, by way of
    reparation. We make an apology for some breach of propriety or
    decorum (like rude expressions, unbecoming conduct, etc.), or some
    deficiency in what might be reasonably expected. We offer an excuse
    when we have been guilty of some breach or neglect of duty; and we do
    it by way of extenuating our fault, and with a view to be forgiven.
    When an excuse has been accepted, an apology may still, in some
    cases, be necessary or appropriate. "An excuse is not grounded on the
    claim of innocence, but is rather an appeal for favor resting on some
    collateral circumstance. An apology mostly respects the conduct of
    individuals toward each other as equals; it is a voluntary act
    produced by feelings of decorum, or a desire for the good opinion of
    others." Crabb.</p>

     — To Appreciate, Estimate, Esteem. Estimate is an act of judgment;
    esteem is an act of valuing or prizing, and when applied to
    individuals, denotes a sentiment of moral approbation. See Estimate.
    Appreciate lies between the two. As compared with estimate, it
    supposes a union of sensibility with judgment, producing a nice and
    delicate perception. As compared with esteem, it denotes a valuation
    of things according to their appropriate and distinctive excellence,
    and not simply their moral worth. Thus, with reference to the former
    of these (delicate perception), an able writer says. "Women have a
    truer appreciation of character than men;" and another remarks, "It
    is difficult to appreciate the true force and distinctive sense of
    terms which we are every day using." So, also, we speak of the
    difference between two things, as sometimes hardly appreciable. With
    reference to the latter of these (that of valuation as the result of
    a nice perception), we say, "It requires a peculiar cast of character
    to appreciate the poetry of Wordsworth;" "He who has no delicacy
    himself, can not appreciate it in others;" "The thought of death is
    salutary, because it leads us to appreciate worldly things aright."
    Appreciate is much used in cases where something is in danger of
    being overlooked or undervalued; as when we speak of appreciating the
    difficulties of a subject, or the risk of an undertaking. So Lord
    Plunket, referring to an "ominous silence" which prevailed among the
    Irish peasantry, says, "If you knew now to appreciate that silence,
    it is more formidable than the most clamorous opposition." In like
    manner, a person who asks some favor of another is apt to say, "I
    trust you will appreciate my motives in this request." Here we have
    the key to a very frequent use of the word. It is hardly necessary to
    say that appreciate looks on the favorable side of things. we never
    speak of appreciating a man's faults, but his merits. This idea of
    regarding things favorably appears more fully in the word
    appreciative; as when we speak of an appreciative audience, or an
    appreciative review, meaning one that manifests a quick perception
    and a ready valuation of excellence.</p>

    beautiful. They include poetry, music, painting, engraving,
    sculpture, and architecture; but the term is often confined to
    painting, sculpture, and architecture. The liberal arts (artes
    liberales, the higher arts, which, among the Romans, only freemen
    were permitted to pursue) were, in the Middle Ages, these seven
    branches of learning, — grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic,
    geometry, music, and astronomy. In modern times the liberal arts
    include the sciences, philosophy, history, etc., which compose the
    course of academical or collegiate education. Hence, degrees in the
    arts; master and bachelor of arts.
    In America, literature and the elegant arts must grow up side by side
    with the coarser plants of daily necessity. Irving.</p>

    convention. Assemblage, Assembly. An assembly consists only of
    persons; an assemblage may be composed of things as well as persons,

    persons an assembly; since the latter term denotes a body who have
    met, and are acting, in concert for some common end, such as to hear,

    </p>
    <p>Syn.
     — Concurrence; acquiescence; approval; accord.
     — Assent, Consent. Assent is an act of the understanding, consent
    of the will or feelings. We assent to the views of others when our
    minds come to the same conclusion with theirs as to what is true,
    right, or admissible. We consent when there is such a concurrence of
    our will with their desires and wishes that we decide to comply with
    their requests. The king of England gives his assent, not his
    consent, to acts of Parliament, because, in theory at least, he is
    not governed by personal feelings or choice, but by a deliberate,
    judgment as to the common good. We also use assent in cases where a
    proposal is made which involves but little interest or feeling. A
    lady may assent to a gentleman's opening the window; but if he offers
    himself in marriage, he must wait for her consent.</p>

     — To Assert, Affirm, Maintain, Vindicate. To assert is to fasten to
    one's self, and hence to claim. It is, therefore, adversative in its
    nature. We assert our rights and privileges, or the cause of tree
    institutions, as against opposition or denial. To affirm is to
    declare as true. We assert boldly; we affirm positively. To maintain
    is to uphold, and insist upon with earnestness, whatever we have once
    asserted; as, to maintain one's cause, to maintain an argument, to
    maintain the ground we have taken. To vindicate is to use language
    and measures of the strongest kind, in defense of ourselves and those
    for whom we act. We maintain our assertions by adducing proofs,
    facts, or arguments; we are ready to vindicate our rights or
    interests by the utmost exertion of our powers.</p>

    (a) A seizure or taking into custody by virtue of a legal process.
    (b) The writ or percept commanding such seizure or taking.</p>
    <p>Note: The term is applied to a seizure or taking either of persons or
    property. In the serving of process in a civil suit, it is most
    generally applied to the taking of property, whether at common law,
    as a species of distress, to compel defendant's appearance, or under
    local statutes, to satisfy the judgment the plaintiff may recover in
    the action. The terms attachment and arrest are both applied to the
    taking or apprehension of a defendant to compel an appearance in a
    civil action. Attachments are issued at common law and in chancery,
    against persons for contempt of court. In England, attachment is
    employed in some cases where capias is with us, as against a witness
    who fails to appear on summons. In some of the New England States a
    writ of attachment is a species of mesne process upon which the
    property of a defendant may be seized at the commencement of a suit
    and before summons to him, and may be held to satisfy the judgment
    the plaintiff may recover. In other States this writ can issue only
    against absconding debtors and those who conceal themselves. See
    Foreign, Garnishment, Trustee process. Bouvier. Burrill. Blackstone.</p>
    <p>Syn.
     — Attachment, Affection. The leading idea of affection is that of
    warmth and tenderness; the leading idea of attachment is that of
    being bound to some object by strong and lasting ties. There is more
    of sentiment (and sometimes of romance) in affection, and more of
    principle in preserving attachment. We speak of the ardor of the one,
    and the fidelity of the other. There is another distinction in the
    use and application of these words. The term attachment is applied to
    a wider range of objects than affection. A man may have a strong
    attachment to his country, to his profession, to his principles, and
    even to favorite places; in respect to none of these could we use the
    word affection.</p>

    <p>Syn.
     — To Attack, Assail, Assault, Invade. These words all denote a
    violent onset; attack being the generic term, and the others specific
    forms of attack. To attack is to commence the onset; to assail is to
    make a sudden and violent attack, or to make repeated attacks; to
    assault (literally, to leap upon) is to attack physically by a had-
    to-hand approach or by unlawful and insulting violence; to invade is
    to enter by force on what belongs to another. Thus, a person may
    attack by offering violence of any kind; he may assail by means of
    missile weapons; he may assault by direct personal violence; a king
    may invade by marching an army into a country. Figuratively, we may
    say, men attack with argument or satire; they assail with abuse or
    reproaches; they may be assaulted by severe temptations; the rights
    of the people may be invaded by the encroachments of the crown.</p>

    toward an object. Hence it is not synonymous with obtain and procure,

    The attitude of the country was rapidly changing. J. R. Green.
    To strike an attitude, to take an attitude for mere effect.</p>
    <p>Syn.
     — Attitude, Posture. Both of these words describe the visible
    disposition of the limbs. Posture relates to their position merely;
    attitude refers to their fitness for some specific object. The object
    of an attitude is to set forth exhibit some internal feeling; as,
    attitude of wonder, of admiration, of grief, etc. It is, therefore,
    essentially and designedly expressive. Its object is the same with
    that of gesture; viz., to hold forth and represent. Posture has no
    such design. If we speak of posture in prayer, or the posture of
    devotion, it is only the natural disposition of the limbs, without
    any intention to show forth or exhibit.
    'T is business of a painter in his choice of attitudes (posituræ) to
    foresee the effect and harmony of the lights and shadows. Dryden.
    Never to keep the body in the same posture half an hour at a time.

    for him; an attorney in fact.
    (b) A legal agent qualified to act for suitors and defendants in
    legal proceedings; an attorney at law.</p>
    <p>Note: An attorney is either public or private. A private attorney, or
    an attorney in fact, is a person appointed by another, by a letter or
    power of attorney, to transact any business for him out of court; but
    in a more extended sense, this class includes any agent employed in
    any business, or to do any act in pais, for another. A public
    attorney, or attorney at law, is a practitioner in a court of law,
    legally qualified to prosecute and defend actions in such court, on
    the retainer of clients. Bouvier.
     — The attorney at law answers to the procurator of the civilians,
    to the solicitor in chancery, and to the proctor in the
    ecclesiastical and admiralty courts, and all of these are
    comprehended under the more general term lawyer. In Great Britain and
    in some states of the United States, attorneys are distinguished from
    counselors in that the business of the former is to carry on the
    practical and formal parts of the suit. In many states of the United
    States however, no such distinction exists. In England, since 1873,
    attorneys at law are by statute called solicitors. A power, letter,
    or warrant, of attorney, a written authority from one person

    At*trac"tion, n. Etym: [L. attractio: cf. F. attraction.]
    </p>
    <p>1. (Physics)</p>
    <p>Defn: An invisible power in a body by which it draws anything to
    itself; the power in nature acting mutually between bodies or
    ultimate particles, tending to draw them together, or to produce
    their cohesion or combination, and conversely resisting separation.</p>
    <p>Note: Attraction is exerted at both sensible and insensible
    distances, and is variously denominated according to its qualities or
    phenomena. Under attraction at sensible distances, there are, —(1.)
    Attraction of gravitation, which acts at all distances throughout the
    universe, with a force proportional directly to the product of the
    masses of the bodies and inversely to the square of their distances
    apart. (2.) Magnetic, diamagnetic, and electrical attraction, each of
    which is limited in its sensible range and is polar in its action, a
    property dependent on the quality or condition of matter, and not on
    its quantity. Under attraction at insensible distances, there are, —
    (1.) Adhesive attraction, attraction between surfaces of sensible
    extent, or by the medium of an intervening substance. (2.) Cohesive
    attraction, attraction between ultimate particles, whether like or
    unlike, and causing simply an aggregation or a union of those
    particles, as in the absorption of gases by charcoal, or of oxygen by
    spongy platinum, or the process of solidification or crystallization.
    The power in adhesive attraction is strictly the same as that of
    cohesion. (3.) Capillary attraction, attraction causing a liquid to
    rise, in capillary tubes or interstices, above its level outside, as
    in very small glass tubes, or a sponge, or any porous substance, when
    one end is inserted in the liquid. It is a special case of cohesive
    attraction. (4.) Chemical attraction, or affinity, that peculiar
    force which causes elementary atoms, or groups of atoms, to unite to
    form molecules.</p>
    <p>2. The act or property of attracting; the effect of the power or
    operation of attraction. Newton.</p>
    <p>3. The power or act of alluring, drawing to, inviting, or engaging;
    an attractive quality; as, the attraction of beauty or eloquence.</p>
    <p>4. That which attracts; an attractive object or feature.</p>
    <p>Syn.<br>
     — Allurement; enticement; charm.

    Au*then"tic, a. Etym: [OE. autentik, OF. autentique, F. authentique,

    <p>Syn.
     — Authentic, Genuine. These words, as here compared, have reference
    to historical documents. We call a document genuine when it can be
    traced back ultimately to the author or authors from whom it
    professes to emanate. Hence, the word has the meaning, "not changed
    from the original, uncorrupted, unadulterated:" as, a genuine text.
    We call a document authentic when, on the ground of its being thus
    traced back, it may be relied on as true and authoritative (from the
    primary sense of "having an author, vouched for"); hence its extended
    signification, in general literature, of trustworthy, as resting on
    unquestionable authority or evidence; as, an authentic history; an
    authentic report of facts.
    A genuine book is that which was written by the person whose name it
    bears, as the author of it. An authentic book is that which relates
    matters of fact as they really happened. A book may be genuine
    without being, authentic, and a book may be authentic without being
    genuine. Bp. Watson.</p>
    <p>Note: It may be said, however, that some writers use authentic (as,
    an authentic document) in the sense of "produced by its professed
    author, not counterfeit."</p>

    <p>Syn.
     — Ungainly; unhandy; clownish; lubberly; gawky; maladroit;
    bungling; inelegant; ungraceful; unbecoming.
     — Awkward, Clumsy, Uncouth. Awkward has a special reference to
    outward deportment. A man is clumsy in his whole person, he is
    awkward in his gait and the movement of his limbs. Clumsiness is seen
    at the first view. Awkwardness is discovered only when a person
    begins to move. Hence the expressions, a clumsy appearance, and an
    awkward manner. When we speak figuratively of an awkward excuse, we
    think of a want of ease and grace in making it; when we speak of a
    clumsy excuse, we think of the whole thing as coarse and stupid. We
    apply the term uncouth most frequently to that which results from the
    want of instruction or training; as, uncouth manners; uncouth
    language.

    <p>Defn: A tool or instrument of steel, or of iron with a steel edge or
    blade, for felling trees, chopping and splitting wood, hewing timber,

    carpenter's ax, is an ax for hewing timber, made heavier than the
    chopping ax, and with a broader and thinner blade and a shorter
    handle.</p>

    waxe, sixe, mixe, pixe, oxe, fluxe, etc. This superfluous e is not
    dropped; so that, in more than a hundred words ending in x, no one
    thinks of retaining the e except in axe. Analogy requires its
    exclusion here.</p>

    phonology, and analogy, than axe, which has of late become
    prevalent." New English Dict. (Murray).</p>
