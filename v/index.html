            <h2><a id="chap22"></a>V</h2>
            <p>1. V, the twenty-second letter of the English alphabet, is a vocal
            consonant. V and U are only varieties of the same character, U being
            the cursive form, while V is better adapted for engraving, as in
            stone. The two letters were formerly used indiscriminately, and till
            a comparatively recent date words containing them were often classed
            together in dictionaries and other books of reference (see U). The
            letter V is from the Latin alphabet, where it was used both as a
            consonant (about like English w) and as a vowel. The Latin derives it
            from it from a form (V) of the Greek vowel UPSILON (see Y), this
            Greek letter being either from the same Semitic letter as the digamma
            F (see F), or else added by the Greeks to the alphabet which they
            took from the Semitic. Etymologically v is most nearly related to u,
            w, f, b, p; as in vine, wine; avoirdupois, habit, have; safe, save;
            trover, troubadour, trope. See U, F, etc. See Guide to Pronunciation,
            § 265; also §§ 155, 169, 178-179, etc.</p>
            <p>2. As a numeral, V stands for five, in English and Latin.</p>

            </p>
            <p>1. (Physics)</p>
            <p>Defn: A space entirely devoid of matter (called also, by way of
            distinction, absolute vacuum); hence, in a more general sense, a
            space, as the interior of a closed vessel, which has been exhausted
            to a high or the highest degree by an air pump or other artificial
            means; as, water boils at a reduced temperature in a vacuum.</p>
            <p>2. The condition of rarefaction, or reduction of pressure below that
            of the atmosphere, in a vessel, as the condenser of a steam engine,
            which is nearly exhausted of air or steam, etc.; as, a vacuum of 26
            inches of mercury, or 13 pounds per square inch. Vacuum brake, a kind
            of continuous brake operated by exhausting the air from some
            appliance under each car, and so causing the pressure of the
            atmosphere to apply the brakes.
             — Vacuum pan (Technol.), a kind of large closed metallic retort
            used in sugar making for boiling down sirup. It is so connected with
            an exhausting apparatus that a partial vacuum is formed within. This
            allows the evaporation and concentration to take place at a lower
            atmospheric pressure and hence also at a lower temperature, which
            largely obviates the danger of burning the sugar, and shortens the
            process.

            vessel in which the pressure is less than that of the atmosphere, in
            order to prevent collapse.

            or not abiding in it, and usually without the means of honest

            A fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be. Gen. iv. 12.</p>
            <p>Note: In English and American law, vagabond is used in bad sense,
            denoting one who is without a home; a strolling, idle, worthless
            person. Vagabonds are described in old English statutes as "such as
            wake on the night and sleep on the day, and haunt customable taverns
            and alehouses, and routs about; and no man wot from whence they came,
            nor whither they go." In American law, the term vagrant is employed
            in the same sense. Cf Rogue, n., 1. Burrill. Bouvier.</p>

            sodium, etc.) with which it will combine, or for which it can be
            substituted, or with which it can be compared; thus, an atom of
            hydrogen is a monad, and has a valence of one; the atoms of oxygen,

            cases of iodine and osmium respectively. The doctrine of valence has
            been of fundamental importance in distinguishing the equivalence from

            of which is ordinarily that of a liquid or solid.</p>
            <p>Note: The term vapor is sometimes used in a more extended sense, as
            identical with gas; and the difference between the two is not so much
            one of kind as of degree, the latter being applied to all permanently
            elastic fluids except atmospheric air, the former to those elastic
            fluids which lose that condition at ordinary temperatures. The
            atmosphere contains more or less vapor of water, a portion of which,
            on a reduction of temperature, becomes condensed into liquid water in
            the form of rain or dew. The vapor of water produced by boiling,
            especially in its economic relations, is called steam.
            Vapor is any substance in the gaseous condition at the maximum of
            density consistent with that condition. This is the strict and proper
            meaning of the word vapor. Nichol.</p>

            provided with a jacket in the outside partition for holding water, or
            other volatile liquid, by which the temperature may be limited
            exactly to the required degree.
             — Vapor burner, a burner for burning a vaporized hydrocarbon.
             — Vapor density (Chem.), the relative weight of gases and vapors as
            compared with some specific standard, usually hydrogen, but sometimes
            air. The vapor density of gases and vaporizable substances as
            compared with hydrogen, when multiplied by two, or when compared with
            air and multiplied by 28.8, gives the molecular weight.
             — Vapor engine, an engine worked by the expansive force of a vapor,

            See Various.]
            </p>
            <p>1. The quality or state of being various; intermixture or succession
            of different things; diversity; multifariousness.
            Variety is nothing else but a continued novelty. South.
            The variety of colors depends upon the composition of light. Sir I.
            Newton.
            For earth this variety from heaven. Milton.
            There is a variety in the tempers of good men. Atterbury.</p>
            <p>2. That which is various. Specifically: —
            (a) A number or collection of different things; a varied assortment;
            as, a variety of cottons and silks.
            He . . . wants more time to do that variety of good which his soul
            thirsts after. Law.</p>
            <p>(b) Something varying or differing from others of the same general
            kind; one of a number of things that are akin; a sort; as, varieties
            of wood, land, rocks, etc.
            (c) (Biol.) An individual, or group of individuals, of a species
            differing from the rest in some one or more of the characteristics
            typical of the species, and capable either of perpetuating itself for
            a period, or of being perpetuated by artificial means; hence, a
            subdivision, or peculiar form, of a species.</p>
            <p>Note: Varieties usually differ from species in that any two, however
            unlike, will generally propagate indefinitely (unless they are in
            their nature unfertile, as some varieties of rose and other
            cultivated plants); in being a result of climate, food, or other
            extrinsic conditions or influences, but generally by a sudden, rather
            than a gradual, development; and in tending in many cases to lose
            their distinctive peculiarities when the individuals are left to a
            state of nature, and especially if restored to the conditions that
            are natural to typical individuals of the species. Many varieties of
            domesticated animals and of cultivated plants have been directly
            produced by man.
            (d) In inorganic nature, one of those forms in which a species may
            occur, which differ in minor characteristics of structure, color,
            purity of composition, etc.</p>
            <p>Note: These may be viewed as variations from the typical species in
            its most perfect and purest form, or, as is more commonly the case,
            all the forms, including the latter, may rank as Varieties. Thus, the
            sapphire is a blue variety, and the ruby a red variety, of corundum;
            again, calcite has many Varieties differing in form and structure, as
            Iceland spar, dogtooth spar, satin spar, and also others
            characterized by the presence of small quantities of magnesia, iron,
            manganese, etc. Still again, there are Varieties of granite differing
            in structure, as graphic granite, porphyritic granite, and other
            Varieties differing in composition, as albitic granite, hornblendic,
            or syenitic, granite, etc. Geographical variety (Biol.), a variety of
            any species which is coincident with a geographical region, and is
            usually dependent upon, or caused by, peculiarities of climate.
             — Variety hybrid (Biol.), a cross between two individuals of
            different varieties of the same species; a mongrel.</p>
            <p>Syn.
             — Diversity; difference; kind.
             — Variety, Diversity. A man has a variety of employments when he
            does many things which are not a mere repetition of the same act; he
            has a diversity of employments when the several acts performed are
            unlike each other, that is, diverse. In most cases, where there is
            variety there will be more or less of diversity, but not always. One
            who sells railroad tickets performs a great variety of acts in a day,
            while there is but little diversity in his employment.
            All sorts are here that all the earth yields! Variety without end.
            Milton.
            But see in all corporeal nature's scene, What changes, what
            diversities, have been! Blackmore.</p>

            arrangements of the principal subdivisions. I. Phænogamia (called
            also Phanerogamia).</p>
            <p>Defn: Plants having distinct flowers and true seeds. { 1.
            Dicotyledons (called also Exogens).
             — Seeds with two or more cotyledons. Stems with the pith, woody
            fiber, and bark concentrically arranged. Divided into two subclasses:
            Angiosperms, having the woody fiber interspersed with dotted or
            annular ducts, and the seed contained in a true ovary; Gymnosperms,
            having few or no ducts in the woody fiber, and the seeds naked. 2.
            Monocotyledons (called also Endogens).
             — Seeds with single cotyledon. Stems with slender bundles of woody
            fiber not concentrically arranged, and with no true bark.} II.
            Cryptogamia.</p>
            <p>Defn: Plants without true flowers, and reproduced by minute spores of
            various kinds, or by simple cell division. { 1. Acrogens.
             — Plants usually with distinct stems and leaves, existing in two
            alternate conditions, one of which is nonsexual and sporophoric, the
            other sexual and oöphoric. Divided into Vascular Acrogens, or
            Pteridophyta, having the sporophoric plant conspicuous and consisting
            partly of vascular tissue, as in Ferns, Lycopods, and Equiseta, and
            Cellular Acrogens, or Bryophyta, having the sexual plant most
            conspicuous, but destitute of vascular tissue, as in Mosses and Scale
            Mosses. 2. Thallogens.
             — Plants without distinct stem and leaves, consisting of a simple
            or branched mass of cellular tissue, or educed to a single cell.
            Reproduction effected variously. Divided into Algæ, which contain
            chlorophyll or its equivalent, and which live upon air and water, and
            Fungi, which contain no chlorophyll, and live on organic matter.
            (Lichens are now believed to be fungi parasitic on included algæ.}</p>
            <p>Note: Many botanists divide the Phænogamia primarily into Gymnosperms
            and Angiosperms, and the latter into Dicotyledons and Monocotyledons.
            Others consider Pteridophyta and Bryophyta to be separate classes.
            Thallogens are variously divided by different writers, and the places
            for diatoms, slime molds, and stoneworts are altogether uncertain.

            <p>VELOCITY
            Ve*loc"i*ty, n.; pl. Velocities. Etym: [L. velocitas, from velox, -
            ocis, swift, quick; perhaps akin to v to fly (see Volatile): cf. F.
            vélocité.]</p>
            <p>1. Quickness of motion; swiftness; speed; celerity; rapidity; as, the
            velocity of wind; the velocity of a planet or comet in its orbit or
            course; the velocity of a cannon ball; the velocity of light.</p>
            <p>Note: In such phrases, velocity is more generally used than celerity.
            We apply celerity to animals; as, a horse or an ostrich runs with
            celerity; but bodies moving in the air or in ethereal space move with
            greater or less velocity, not celerity. This usage is arbitrary, and
            perhaps not universal.</p>
            <p>2. (Mech.)</p>
            <p>Defn: Rate of motion; the relation of motion to time, measured by the
            number of units of space passed over by a moving body or point in a
            unit of time, usually the number of feet passed over in a second. See
            the Note under Speed. Angular velocity. See under Angular.
             — Initial velocity, the velocity of a moving body at starting;
            especially, the velocity of a projectile as it leaves the mouth of a
            firearm from which it is discharged.
             — Relative velocity, the velocity with which a body approaches or
            recedes from another body, whether both are moving or only one.
             — Uniform velocity, velocity in which the same number of units of
            space are described in each successive unit of time.
             — Variable velocity, velocity in which the space described varies
            from instant, either increasing or decreasing; — in the former case
            called accelerated velocity, in the latter, retarded velocity; the
            acceleration or retardation itself being also either uniform or
            variable.
             — Virtual velocity. See under Virtual.</p>
            <p>Note: In variable velocity, the velocity, strictly, at any given
            instant, is the rate of motion at that instant, and is expressed by
            the units of space, which, if the velocity at that instant were
            continued uniform during a unit of time, would be described in the
            unit of time; thus, the velocity of a falling body at a given instant
            is the number of feet which, if the motion which the body has at that
            instant were continued uniformly for one second, it would pass
            through in the second. The scientific sense of velocity differs from
            the popular sense in being applied to all rates of motion, however
            slow, while the latter implies more or less rapidity or quickness of
            motion.</p>
            <p>Syn.<br>
             — Swiftness; celerity; rapidity; fleetness; speed.

            <p>Syn.
             — Mercenary; hireling; vendible.
             — Venal, Mercenary. One is mercenary who is either actually a
            hireling (as, mercenary soldiers, a mercenary judge, etc.), or is
            governed by a sordid love of gain; hence, we speak of mercenary
            motives, a mercenary marriage, etc. Venal goes further, and supposes
            either an actual purchase, or a readiness to be purchased, which
            places a person or thing wholly in the power of the purchaser; as, a
            venal press. Brissot played ingeniously on the latter word in his
            celebrated saying, " My pen is venal that it may not be mercenary,"
            meaning that he wrote books, and sold them to the publishers, in
            order to avoid the necessity of being the hireling of any political
            party.
            Thus needy wits a vile revenue made, And verse became a mercenary
            trade. Dryden.

            from the Christian era, by a decree of the National Convention in
            1793. The 22d of September, 1792, which had been fixed upon as the

            calendar. In this calendar, the year, which began at midnight of the
            day of the autumnal equinox, was divided into twelve months of thirty

            <p>Defn: A statement, propounded by the Danish philologist Karl Verner
            in 1875, which explains certain apparent exceptions to Grimm's law by
            the original position of the accent. Primitive Indo-European k, t, p,
            became first in Teutonic h, th, f, and appear without further change
            in old Teutonic, if the accent rested on the preceding syllable; but
            these sounds became voiced and produced g, d, b, if the accent was
            originally on a different syllable. Similarly s either remained
            unchanged, or it became z and later r. Example: Skt. sapta (accent on
            ultima), Gr. 'e`pta, Gothic sibun (seven). Examples in English are
            dead by the side of death, to rise and to rear.</p>

            Version.] (Geom.)
            </p>
            <p>Defn: The turning factor of a quaternion.</p>
            <p>Note: The change of one vector into another is considered in
            quaternions as made up of two operations; 1st, the rotation of the
            first vector so that it shall be parallel to the second; 2d, the
            change of length so that the first vector shall be equal to the
            second. That which expresses in amount and kind the first operation
            is a versor, and is denoted geometrically by a line at right angles
            to the plane in which the rotation takes place, the length of this
            line being proportioned to the amount of rotation. That which
            expresses the second operation is a tensor. The product of the versor
            and tensor expresses the total operation, and is called a quaternion.

            <p>VERTEBRA
            Ver"te*bra, n.; pl. Vertebræ. Etym: [L. vertebra, fr. vertere to
            turn, change. See Verse.]</p>
            <p>1. (Anat.)</p>
            <p>Defn: One of the serial segments of the spinal column.</p>
            <p>Note: In many fishes the vertebræ are simple cartilaginous disks or
            short cylinders, but in the higher vertebrates they are composed of
            many parts, and the vertebræ in different portions of the same column
            vary very greatly. A well-developed vertebra usually consists of a
            more or less cylindrical and solid body, or centrum, which is
            surmounted dorsally by an arch, leaving an opening which forms a part
            of the canal containing the spinal cord. From this dorsal, or neural,
            arch spring various processes, or apophyses, which have received
            special names: a dorsal, or neural, spine, spinous process, or
            neurapophysis, on the middle of the arch; two anterior and two
            posterior articular processes, or zygapophyses; and one or two
            transverse processes on each side. In those vertebræ which bear well-
            developed ribs, a tubercle near the end of the rib articulates at a
            tubercular facet on the transverse process (diapophysis), while the
            end, or head, of the rib articulates at a more ventral capitular
            facet which is sometimes developed into a second, or ventral,
            transverse process (parapophysis). In vertebrates with well-developed
            hind limbs, the spinal column is divided into five regions in each of
            which the vertebræ are specially designated: those vertebræ in front
            of, or anterior to, the first vertebra which bears ribs connected
            with the sternum are cervical; all those which bear ribs and are back
            of the cervicals are dorsal; the one or more directly supporting the
            pelvis are sacral and form the sacrum; those between the sacral and
            dorsal are lumbar; and all those back of the sacral are caudal, or
            coccygeal. In man there are seven cervical vertebræ, twelve dorsal,
            five lumbar, five sacral, and usually four, but sometimes five and
            rarely three, coccygeal.</p>

            the vestibule, and, in the United States, is often long and narrow,
            serving as a passage to the several apartments. In England, the hall
            is generally square or oblong, and a long, narrow space of entrance
            is called a passage, not a hall, as in America. Vestibule is often
            used in a figurative sense to denote a place of entrance. "The
            citizens of Rome placed the images of their ancestors in the

             — Trace; mark; sign; token.
             — Vestige, Trace. These words agree in marking some indications of
            the past, but differ to some extent in their use and application.
            Vestige is used chiefly in a figurative sense, for the remains
            something long passed away; as, the vestiges of ancient times;
            vestiges of the creation. A trace is literally something drawn out in
            a line, and may be used in this its primary sense, or figuratively,
            to denote a sign or evidence left by something that has passed by, or
            ceased to exist. Vestige usually supposes some definite object of the
            past to be left behind; while a trace may be a mere indication that
            something has been present or is present; as, traces of former
            population; a trace of poison in a given substance.</p>

            produced by gravity, and of any degree of slowness, while the former
            applies especially to the quick, short motion to and fro which
            results from elasticity, or the action of molecular forces among the
            particles of a body when disturbed from their position of rest, as in

            of the line of rest, in distinction from the opposite. Two particles
            are said to be in the same phase when they are moving in the same
            direction and with the same velocity, or in corresponding parts of
            their paths.</p>

            ears, and was armed with a dagger of lath: one of his chief

            and belaboring him with the dagger of lath till he made him roar. The
            Devil, however, always carried him off in the end. Nares.

             — Virtual velocity (Mech.), a minute hypothetical displacement,
            assumed in analysis to facilitate the investigation of statical
            problems. With respect to any given force of a number of forces
            holding a material system in equilibrium, it is the projection, upon
            the direction of the force, of a line joining its point of
            application with a new position of that point indefinitely near to
            the first, to which the point is conceived to have been moved,
            without disturbing the equilibrium of the system, or the connections
            of its parts with each other. Strictly speaking, it is not a velocity
            but a length.

            (a) Physical force.
            (b) Moral power. Principle of vis viva (Mech.), the principle that
            the difference between the aggregate work of the accelerating forces
            of a system and that of the retarding forces is equal to one half the
            vis viva accumulated or lost in the system while the work is being
            done.
             — Vis impressa Etym: [L.] (Mech.), force exerted, as in moving a
            body, or changing the direction of its motion; impressed force.
             — Vis inertiæ. Etym: [L.] (a) The resistance of matter, as when a
            body at rest is set in motion, or a body in motion is brought to
            rest, or has its motion changed, either in direction or in velocity.
            (b) Inertness; inactivity. Vis intertiæ and inertia are not strictly

             — Vis viva Etym: [L.] (Mech.), living force; the force of a body
            moving against resistance, or doing work, in distinction from vis
            mortua, or dead force; the kinetic energy of a moving body; the
            capacity of a moving body to do work by reason of its being in
            motion. See Kinetic energy, in the Note under Energy. The term vis
            viva is not usually understood to include that part of the kinetic
            energy of the body which is due to the vibrations of its molecules.</p>

            f, s, sh, etc., and also whisper.</p>
            <p>Note: Voice, in this sense, is produced by vibration of the so-called
            vocal cords in the larynx (see Illust. of Larynx) which act upon the
            air, not in the manner of the strings of a stringed instrument, but
            as a pair of membranous tongues, or reeds, which, being continually
            forced apart by the outgoing current of breath, and continually
            brought together again by their own elasticity and muscular tension,
            break the breath current into a series of puffs, or pulses,
            sufficiently rapid to cause the sensation of tone. The power, or
            loudness, of such a tone depends on the force of the separate pulses,
            and this is determined by the pressure of the expired air, together
            with the resistance on the part of the vocal cords which is
            continually overcome. Its pitch depends on the number of aërial
            pulses within a given time, that is, on the rapidity of their
            succession. See Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 5, 146, 155.</p>

            Vo*li"tion, n. Etym: [F., fr. L. volo I will, velle to will, be
            willing. See Voluntary.]</p>
            <p>1. The act of willing or choosing; the act of forming a purpose; the
            exercise of the will.
            Volition is the actual exercise of the power the mind has to order
            the consideration of any idea, or the forbearing to consider it.
            Locke.
            Volition is an act of the mind, knowingly exerting that dominion it
            takes itself to have over any part of the man, by employing it in, or
            withholding it from, any particular action. Locke.</p>

            <p>Syn.
             — Will; choice; preference; determination; purpose.
             — Volition, Choice. Choice is the familiar, and volition the
            scientific, term for the same state of the will; viz., an "elective
            preference." When we have "made up our minds" (as we say) to a thing,
            i. e., have a settled state of choice respecting it, that state is
            called an immanent volition; when we put forth any particular act of
            choice, that act is called an emanent, or executive, or imperative,
            volition. When an immanent, or settled state of, choice, is one which
            controls or governs a series of actions, we call that state a
            predominant volition; while we give the name of subordinate volitions
            to those particular acts of choice which carry into effect the object
            sought for by the governing or "predominant volition." See Will.</p>
