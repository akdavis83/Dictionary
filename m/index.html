            <h2><a id="chap13"></a>M<br>
            M (em).</h2>
            <p>1. M, the thirteenth letter of the English alphabet, is a vocal
            consonant, and from the manner of its formation, is called the labio-
            nasal consonant. See Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 178-180, 242.</p>
            <p>The letter M came into English from the Greek, through the Latin, the
            form of the Greek letter being further derived from the Phonician,
            and ultimately, it is believed, from the Egyptian. Etymologically M
            is related to n, in lime, linden; emmet, ant; also to b.</p>
            <p>M is readily followed by b and p. the position of the lips in the
            formation of both letters being the same. The relation of b and m is
            the same as that of d and t to n. and that of g and k to ng.</p>
            <p>2. As a numeral, M stands for one thousand, both in English and
            Latin.</p>

            together produce that number. [Written also em.]</p>

            <p>1. In general, any combination of bodies so connected that their
            relative motions are constrained, and by means of which force and
            motion may be transmitted and modified, as a screw and its nut, or a
            lever arranged to turn about a fulcrum or a pulley about its pivot,
            etc.; especially, a construction, more or less complex, consisting of
            a combination of moving parts, or simple mechanical elements, as
            wheels, levers, cams, etc., with their supports and connecting
            framework, calculated to constitute a prime mover, or to receive
            force and motion from a prime mover or from another machine, and
            transmit, modify, and apply them to the production of some desired
            mechanical effect or work, as weaving by a loom, or the excitation of

            in the manufacture of cloth, etc. Where the effect is chemical, or
            other than mechanical, the contrivance is usually denominated an
            apparatus, not a machine; as, a bleaching apparatus. Many large,
            powerful, or specially important pieces of mechanism are called
            engines; as, a steam engine, fire engine, graduating engine, etc.
            Although there is no well-settled distinction between the terms
            engine and machine among practical men, there is a tendency to
            restrict the application of the former to contrivances in which the
            operating part is not distinct from the motor.</p>

            <p>MALARIA PARASITE<br>
            Malaria parasite.
            </p>
            <p>Defn: Any of several minute protozoans of the genus Plasmodium (syn.
            Hæmatozoön) which in their adult condition live in the tissues of
            mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles (which see) and when transferred to
            the blood of man, by the bite of the mosquito, produce malaria. The
            young parasites, or sporozoites, enter the red blood corpuscles,
            growing at their expense, undergoing sporulation, and finally
            destroying the corpuscles, thus liberating in the blood plasma an
            immense number of small spores called merozoites. An indefinite but
            not ultimated number of such generations may follow, but if meanwhile
            the host is bitten by a mosquito, the parasites develop into gametes
            in the stomach of the insect. These conjugate, the zygote thus
            produced divides, forming spores, and eventually sporozoites, which,
            penetrating to the salivary glands of the mosquito, may be introduced
            into a new host. The attacks of the disease coincide with the
            dissolution of the corpuscles and liberation of the spores and
            products of growth of the parasites into the blood plasma. Several
            species of the parasite are distinguished, as P. vivax, producing
            tertian malaria; P. malariæ, quartan malaria; and P. (subgenus
            Laverania) falciferum, the malarial fever of summer and autumn common
            in the tropics.</p>

            It is levorotatory or dextrorotatory according to the temperature and
            concentration. An artificial variety is a derivative of succinic

            <p>1. Enmity of heart; malevolence; ill will; a spirit delighting in
            harm or misfortune to another; a disposition to injure another; a
            malignant design of evil. "Nor set down aught in malice." Shak.
            Envy, hatred, and malice are three distinct passions of the mind. Ld.
            Holt.</p>
            <p>2. (Law)</p>
            <p>Defn: Any wicked or mischievous intention of the mind; a depraved
            inclination to mischief; an intention to vex, annoy, or injure
            another person, or to do a wrongful act without just cause or cause
            or excuse; a wanton disregard of the rights or safety of others;

            <p>Syn.

            animosity; malignity; maliciousness; rancor; virulence. See Spite.
             — Malevolence, Malignity, Malignancy. Malice is a stronger word
            than malevolence, which may imply only a desire that evil may befall
            another, while malice desires, and perhaps intends, to bring it
            about. Malignity is intense and deepseated malice. It implies a
            natural delight in hating and wronging others. One who is malignant
            must be both malevolent and malicious; but a man may be malicious
            without being malignant.
            Proud tyrants who maliciously destroy And ride o'er ruins with
            malignant joy. Somerville.
            in some connections, malignity seems rather more pertinently applied
            to a radical depravity of nature, and malignancy to indications of
            this depravity, in temper and conduct in particular instances. Cogan.</p>

            <p>Defn: An optical device for making an indicator diagram for high-
            speed engines. It consists of a light-tight box or camera having at
            one end a small convex mirror which reflects a beam of light on to
            the ground glass or photographic plate at the other end. The mirror
            is pivoted so that it can be moved in one direction by a small
            plunger operated by an elastic metal diaphragm which closes a tube
            connected with the engine cylinder. It is also moved at right angles
            to this direction by a reducing motion, called a reproducer, so as to
            copy accurately on a smaller scale the motion of the engine piston.
            The resultant of these two movements imparts to the reflected beam of
            light a motion similar to that of the pencil of the ordinary
            indicator, and this can be traced on the sheet of ground glass, or
            photographed.</p>

            to be present were called missa catechumenorum, ending with the

            that the sacrifice proper began. At its close the same words were

            Mass, n. Etym: [OE. masse, F. masse, L. massa; akin to Gr. Macerate.]
            </p>
            <p>1. A quantity of matter cohering together so as to make one body, or
            an aggregation of particles or things which collectively make one
            body or quantity, usually of considerable size; as, a mass of ore,
            metal, sand, or water.
            If it were not for these principles, the bodies of the earth,
            planets, comets, sun, and all things in them, would grow cold and
            freeze, and become inactive masses. Sir I. Newton.

            <p>Defn: The quantity of matter which a body contains, irrespective of
            its bulk or volume.</p>
            <p>Note: Mass and weight are often used, in a general way, as
            interchangeable terms, since the weight of a body is proportional to
            its mass (under the same or equal gravitative forces), and the mass
            is usually ascertained from the weight. Yet the two ideas, mass and
            weight, are quite distinct. Mass is the quantity of matter in a body;
            weight is the comparative force with which it tends towards the
            center of the earth. A mass of sugar and a mass of lead are assumed
            to be equal when they show an equal weight by balancing each other in
            the scales. Blue mass. See under Blue.

            higher classes; the populace.</p>

            their family. Shak.

            mechanics and chemistry; — said especially of those sciences which
            treat of such phenomena as seem to depend on the laws both of
            mechanics and chemistry, as electricity and magnetism.</p>
            <p>MECHANICS<br>
            Me*chan"ics, n. Etym: [Cf. F. mécanique.]
            </p>
            <p>Defn: That science, or branch of applied mathematics, which treats of
            the action of forces on bodies.</p>
            <p>Note: That part of mechanics which considers the action of forces in
            producing rest or equilibrium is called statics; that which relates
            to such action in producing motion is called dynamics. The term
            mechanics includes the action of forces on all bodies, whether solid,
            liquid, or gaseous. It is sometimes, however, and formerly was often,
            used distinctively of solid bodies only: The mechanics of liquid
            bodies is called also hydrostatics, or hydrodynamics, according as
            the laws of rest or of motion are considered. The mechanics of
            gaseous bodies is called also pneumatics. The mechanics of fluids in
            motion, with special reference to the methods of obtaining from them
            useful results, constitutes hydraulics. Animal mechanics (Physiol.),
            that portion of physiology which has for its object the investigation
            of the laws of equilibrium and motion in the animal body. The most
            important mechanical principle is that of the lever, the bones
            forming the arms of the levers, the contractile muscles the power,
            the joints the fulcra or points of support, while the weight of the
            body or of the individual limbs constitutes the weight or resistance.
             — Applied mechanics, the principles of abstract mechanics applied
            to human art; also, the practical application of the laws of matter
            and motion to the construction of machines and structures of all
            kinds.</p>

            <p>Syn.
             — Memory, Remembrance, Recollection, Reminiscence. Memory is the
            generic term, denoting the power by which we reproduce past
            impressions. Remembrance is an exercise of that power when things
            occur spontaneously to our thoughts. In recollection we make a
            distinct effort to collect again, or call back, what we know has been
            formerly in the mind. Reminiscence is intermediate between
            remembrance and recollection, being a conscious process of recalling
            past occurrences, but without that full and varied reference to
            particular things which characterizes recollection. "When an idea
            again recurs without the operation of the like object on the external
            sensory, it is remembrance; if it be sought after by the mind, and
            with pain and endeavor found, and brought again into view, it is
            recollection." Locke. To draw to memory, to put on record; to record.

            <p>MENDEL'S LAW<br>
            Men"del's law.
            </p>
            <p>Defn: A principle governing the inheritance of many characters in
            animals and plants, discovered by Gregor J. Mendel (Austrian
            Augustinian abbot, 1822-84) in breeding experiments with peas. He
            showed that the height, color, and other characters depend on the
            presence of determinating factors behaving as units. In any given
            germ cell each of these is either present or absent. The following
            example (using letters as symbols of the determining factors and
            hence also of the individuals possessing them) shows the operation of
            the law: Tallness being due to a factor T, a tall plant, arising by
            the union in fertilization of two germ cells both bearing this
            factor, is TT; a dwarf, being without T, is tt. Crossing these,
            crossbreeds, Tt, result (called generation F1). In the formation of
            the germ cells of these crossbreeds a process of segregation occurs
            such that germ cells, whether male or female, are produced of two
            kinds, T and t, in equal numbers. The T cells bear the factor
            "tallness," the t cells are devoid of it. The offspring, generation
            F2, which arise from the chance union of these germ cells in pairs,
            according to the law of probability, are therefore on an average in
            the following proportions:</p>
            <p>1 TT : 2 Tt : 1 tt;</p>
            <p>and thus plants pure in tallness (TT) and dwarfness (tt), as well as
            crossbreeds (Tt), are formed by the interbreeding of crossbreeds.
            Frequently, as in this example, owning to what is called the
            dominance of a factor, the operation of Mendel's law may be
            complicated by the fact that when a dominant factor (as T) occurs
            with its allelomorph (as t), called recessive, in the crossbreed Tt,
            the individual Tt is itself indistinguishable from the pure form TT.
            Generation F1, containing only the Tt form, consists entirely of
            dominants (tall plants) and generation F2 consists of three dominants
            (2 Tt, 1 TT) to one dwarf (tt), which, displaying the feature
            suppressed in F1, is called recessive. Such qualitative and numerical
            regularity has been proved to exist in regard to very diverse
            qualities or characters which compose living things, both wild and
            domesticated, such as colors of flowers, of hair or eyes, patterns,
            structure, chemical composition, and power of resisting certain
            diseases. The diversity of forms produced in crossbreeding by
            horticulturists and fanciers generally results from a process of
            analytical variation or recombination of the factors composing the
            parental types. Purity of type consequently acquires a specific
            meaning. An individual is pure in respect of a given character when
            it results from the union of two sexual cells both bearing that
            character, or both without it.</p>

            <p>METAPHYSICS
            Met`a*phys"ics, n. Etym: [Gr. métaphysique. See Physics. The term was
            first used by the followers of Aristotle as a name for that part of
            his writings which came after, or followed, the part which treated of
            physics.]</p>
            <p>1. The science of real as distinguished from phenomenal being;
            ontology; also, the science of being, with reference to its abstract
            and universal conditions, as distinguished from the science of
            determined or concrete being; the science of the conceptions and
            relations which are necessarily implied as true of every kind of
            being; phylosophy in general; first principles, or the science of
            first principles.</p>
            <p>Note: Metaphysics is distinguished as general and special. General
            metaphysics is the science of all being as being. Special metaphysics
            is the science of one kind of being; as, the metaphysics of
            chemistry, of morals, or of politics. According to Kant, a systematic
            exposition of those notions and truths, the knowledge of which is
            altogether independent of experience, would constitute the science of
            metaphysics.
            Commonly, in the schools, called metaphysics, as being part of the
            philosophy of Aristotle, which hath that for title; but it is in
            another sense: for there it signifieth as much as "books written or
            placed after his natural philosophy." But the schools take them for
            "books of supernatural philosophy;" for the word metaphysic will bear
            both these senses. Hobbes.
            Now the science conversant about all such inferences of unknown being
            from its known manifestations, is called ontology, or metaphysics
            proper. Sir W. Hamilton.
            Metaphysics are [is] the science which determines what can and what
            can not be known of being, and the laws of being, a priori.
            Coleridge.</p>
            <p>2. Hence: The scientific knowledge of mental phenomena; mental
            philosophy; psychology.
            Metaphysics, in whatever latitude the term be taken, is a science or
            complement of sciences exclusively occupied with mind. Sir W.
            Hamilton.

            <p>Note: As a rule, in the old English law, offenses capitally
            punishable were felonies; all other indictable offenses were
            misdemeanors. In common usage, the word crime is employed to denote
            the offenses of a deeper and more atrocious dye, while small faults
            and omissions of less consequence are comprised under the gentler
            name of misdemeanors. Blackstone. The distinction, however, between
            felonies and misdemeanors is purely arbitrary, and is in most
            jurisdictions either abrogated or so far reduced as to be without
            practical value. Cf. Felony. Wharton.</p>

            the poorest tenement districts of Rome, Italy), and first fully
            described by her in 1909. Leading features are freedom for physical
            activity (no stationary desks and chairs), informal and individual
            instruction, the very early development of writing, and an extended
            sensory and motor training (with special emphasis on vision, touch,

            method are borrowed from current methods used in many institutions

            the work of the French-American physician Edouard O. Seguin (1812-
            80).</p>

            accompanies the dance with castanets.</p>
            <p>2. A dance formerly common in England, often performed in pagenats,
            processions, and May games. The dancers, grotesquely dressed and
            ornamented, took the parts of Robin Hood, Maidmarian, and other

            from the angles of the outer one to those of the inner, and from the
            middle of each side of the outer square to that of the inner. The
            game is played by two persons with nine or twelve pieces each (hence
            called nine-men's morris or twelve-men's morris). The pieces are
            placed alternately, and each player endeavors to prevent his opponent
            from making a straight row of three. Should either succeed in making
            a row, he may take up one of his opponent's pieces, and he who takes
            off all of his opponent's pieces wins the game.</p>

            <p>1. (Law)</p>
            <p>Defn: A conveyance of property, upon condition, as security for the
            payment of a debt or the preformance of a duty, and to become void
            upon payment or performance according to the stipulated terms; also,
            the written instrument by which the conveyance is made.</p>
            <p>Note: It was called a mortgage (or dead pledge) because, whatever
            profit it might yield, it did not thereby redeem itself, but became
            lost or dead to the mortgager upon breach of the condition. But in
            equity a right of redemption is an inseparable incident of a mortgage
            until the mortgager is debarred by his own laches, or by judicial
            decree. Cowell. Kent.</p>

            <p>Note: The word multiplication is sometimes used in mathematics,
            particularly in multiple algebra, to denote any distributive
            operation expressed by one symbol upon any quantity or any thing
            expressed by another symbol. Corresponding extensions of meaning are
            given to the words multiply, multiplier, multiplicand, and product.
            Thus, since f(x + y) = fx + fy (see under Distributive), where f(x +
            y), fx, and fy indicate the results of any distributive operation
            represented by the symbol f upon x + y, x, and y, severally, then
            because of many very useful analogies f(x + y) is called the product
            of f and x + y, and the operation indicated by f is called
            multiplication. Cf. Facient, n., 2.</p>

            <p>Note: Muscles are of two kinds, striated and nonstriated. The
            striated muscles, which, in most of the higher animals, constitute
            the principal part of the flesh, exclusive of the fat, are mostly
            under the control of the will, or voluntary, and are made up of great
            numbers of elongated fibres bound together into bundles and inclosed
            in a sheath of connective tissue, the perimysium. Each fiber is
            inclosed in a delicate membrane (the sarcolemma), is made up of
            alternate segments of lighter and darker material which give it a
            transversely striated appearance, and contains, scattered through its
            substance, protoplasmic nuclei, the so-called muscle corpuscles. The
            nonstriated muscles are involuntary. They constitute a large part of
            the walls of the alimentary canal, blood vessels, uterus, and
            bladder, and are found also in the iris, skin, etc. They are made up
            of greatly elongated cells, usually grouped in bundles or sheets.</p>

            <p>1. Not speaking; uttering no sound; silent.
            All the heavenly choir stood mute, And silence was in heaven. Milton.</p>
            <p>Note: In law a prisoner is said to stand mute, when, upon being
            arranged, he makes no answer, or does not plead directly, or will not

             — Mute, Silent, Dumb. One is silent who does not speak; one is dumb
            who can not, for want of the proper organs; as, a dumb beast, etc.;

            Such is the case with most of those who never speak from childhood;
            they are not ordinarily dumb, but mute because they are deaf, and
            therefore never learn to talk; and hence their more appropriate name
            is deaf-mutes.
            They spake not a word; But, like dumb statues, or breathing stones,
            Gazed each on other. Shak.
            All sat mute, Pondering the danger with deep thoughts. Milton.</p>

            </p>
            <p>1. One who does not speak, whether from physical inability,
