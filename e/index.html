            <h2><a id="chap05"></a>E</h2>
            <p>1. The fifth letter of the English alphabet.</p>
            <p>Note: It derives its form, name, and value from the Latin, the form
            and value being further derived from the Greek, into which it came
            from the Phoenician, and ultimately, probably, from the Egyptian. Its
            etymological relations are closest with the vowels i, a, and o, as
            illustrated by to fall, to fell; man, pl. men; drink, drank, drench;
            dint, dent; doom, deem; goose, pl. geese; beef, OF. boef, L. bos; and
            E. cheer, OF. chiere, LL. cara.</p>
            <p>Note: The letter e has in English several vowel sounds, the two
            principal being its long or name sound, as in eve, me, and the short,
            as in end, best. Usually at the end of words it is silent, but serves
            to indicate that the preceding vowel has its long sound, where
            otherwise it would be short, as in mane, as in cane, m, which without
            the final e would be pronounced m, c, m. After c and g, the final e
            indicates that these letters are to be pronounced as s and j;
            respectively, as in lace, rage. See Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 74-97.</p>
            <p>2. (Mus.)</p>
            <p>Defn: E is the third tone of the model diatonic scale. E (E flat) is
            a tone which is intermediate between D and E.</p>
            <h5>E-
            E-.</h5>
            <p>Defn: A Latin prefix meaning out, out of, from; also, without. See<br>
            Ex-.

            <p>EACH<br>
            Each, a. or a. pron. Etym: [OE. eche, ælc, elk, ilk, AS. ælc; a<br>
            always + gelic like; akin to OD. ieg, OHG. , MHG. iegelich. Aye,<br>
            Like, and cf. Either, Every, Ilk.]

            <p>1. Every one of the two or more individuals composing a number of
            objects, considered separately from the rest. It is used either with
            or without a following noun; as, each of you or each one of you.
            "Each of the combatants." Fielding.</p>
            <p>Note: To each corresponds other. "Let each esteem other better than
            himself." Each other, used elliptically for each the other. It is our
            duty to assist each other; that is, it is our duty, each to assist
            the other, each being in the nominative and other in the objective
            case.
            It is a bad thing that men should hate each other; but it is far
            worse that they should contract the habit of cutting one another's
            throats without hatred. Macaulay.
            Let each His adamantine coat gird well. Milton.
            In each cheek appears a pretty dimple. Shak.

            I know each lane and every alley green. Milton.
            In short each man's happiness depends upon himself. Sterne.</p>
            <p>Note: This use of each for every, though common in Scotland and in<br>
            America, is now un-English. Fitzed. Hall.

            aigre, fr. L. acer sharp, sour, spirited, zealous; akin to Gr. a
            point; fr. a root signifying to be sharp. Cf. Acrid, Edge.]</p>

            perform, or obtain; keenly desirous; hotly longing; earnest; zealous;

            And gazed for tidings in my eager eyes. Shak.
            How eagerly ye follow my disgraces! Shak.
            When to her eager lips is brought Her infant's thrilling kiss. Keble.

            <p>4. Brittle; inflexible; not ductile. [Obs.]
            Gold will be sometimes so eager, as artists call it, that it will as
            little endure the hammer as glass itself. Locke.</p>
            <p>Syn.
             — Earnest; ardent; vehement; hot; impetuous; fervent; intense;
            impassioned; zealous; forward. See Earnest.
             — Eager, Earnest. Eager marks an excited state of desire or
            passion; thus, a child is eager for a plaything, a hungry man is
            eager for food, a covetous man is eager for gain. Eagerness is liable
            to frequent abuses, and is good or bad, as the case may be. It
            relates to what is praiseworthy or the contrary. Earnest denotes a
            permanent state of mind, feeling, or sentiment. It is always taken in
            a good sense; as, a preacher is earnest in his appeals to the
            conscience; an agent is earnest in his solicitations.</p>

            Auricle, Orillon.]
            </p>
            <p>1. The organ of hearing; the external ear.</p>
            <p>Note: In man and the higher vertebrates, the organ of hearing is very
            complicated, and is divisible into three parts: the external ear,
            which includes the pinna or auricle and meatus or external opening;
            the middle ear, drum, or tympanum; and the internal ear, or
            labyrinth. The middle ear is a cavity connected by the Eustachian
            tube with the pharynx, separated from the opening of the external ear
            by the tympanic membrane, and containing a chain of three small
            bones, or ossicles, named malleus, incus, and stapes, which connect
            this membrane with the internal ear. The essential part of the
            internal ear where the fibers of the auditory nerve terminate, is the
            membranous labyrinth, a complicated system of sacs and tubes filled
            with a fluid (the endolymph), and lodged in a cavity, called the bony
            labyrinth, in the periotic bone. The membranous labyrinth does not
            completely fill the bony labyrinth, but is partially suspended in it
            in a fluid (the perilymph). The bony labyrinth consists of a central
            cavity, the vestibule, into which three semicircular canals and the
            canal of the cochlea (spirally coiled in mammals) open. The
            vestibular portion of the membranous labyrinth consists of two sacs,
            the utriculus and sacculus, connected by a narrow tube, into the
            former of which three membranous semicircular canals open, while the
            latter is connected with a membranous tube in the cochlea containing
            the organ of Corti. By the help of the external ear the sonorous
            vibrations of the air are concentrated upon the tympanic membrane and
            set it vibrating, the chain of bones in the middle ear transmits
            these vibrations to the internal ear, where they cause certain
            delicate structures in the organ of Corti, and other parts of the
            membranous labyrinth, to stimulate the fibers of the auditory nerve
            to transmit sonorous impulses to the brain.</p>
            <p>2. The sense of hearing; the perception of sounds; the power of
            discriminating between different tones; as, a nice ear for music; —
            in the singular only.
            Songs . . . not all ungrateful to thine ear. Tennyson.</p>
            <p>3. That which resembles in shape or position the ear of an animal;
            any prominence or projection on an object, — usually one for support
            or attachment; a lug; a handle; as, the ears of a tub, a skillet, or
            dish. The ears of a boat are outside kneepieces near the bow. See
            Illust. of Bell.</p>
            <p>4. (Arch.)
            (a) Same as Acroterium (a).
            (b) Same as Crossette.</p>
            <p>5. Privilege of being kindly heard; favor; attention.
            Dionysius . . . would give no ear to his suit. Bacon.
            Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears. Shak.
            About the ears, in close proximity to; near at hand.
             — By the ears, in close contest; as, to set by the ears; to fall
            together by the ears; to be by the ears.
             — Button ear (in dogs), an ear which falls forward and completely

             — Earnest, Pledge. These words are here compared as used in their

            that more is coming of the same kind; a pledge, like money deposited,
            affords security and ground of reliance for the future. Washington
            gave earnest of his talent as commander by saving his troops after
            Braddock's defeat; his fortitude and that of his soldiers during the

            the Russian Church), using the vernacular (or some ancient form of
            it) in divine service and varying in many points of detail, but
            standing in full communion with each other and united as equals in a
            great federation. The highest five authorities are the patriarch of
            Constantinople, or ecumenical patriarch (whose position is not one of
            supremacy, but of precedence), the patriarch of Alexandria, the
            patriarch of Jerusalem, the patriarch of Antioch, and the Holy Synod
            of Russia. The Eastern Church accepts the first seven ecumenical
            councils (and is hence styled only schismatic, not heretical, by the
            Roman Catholic Church), has as its creed the Niceno-
            Constantinopolitan (without the later addition of the filioque,
            which, with the doctrine it represents, the church decisively
            rejects), baptizes infants with trine immersion, makes confirmation
            follow immediately upon baptism, administers the Communion in both
            kinds (using leavened bread) and to infants as well as adults,
            permits its secular clergy to marry before ordination and to keep
            their wives afterward, but not to marry a second time, selects its
            bishops from the monastic clergy only, recognizes the offices of
            bishop, priest, and deacon as the three necessary degrees of orders,
            venerates relics and icons, and has an elaborate ritual.</p>

            moon or a planet, though of the nature of an eclipse, is called an
            occultation. The eclipse of a small portion of the sun by Mercury or

            <p>Syn.
             — Economy, Frugality, Parsimony. Economy avoids all waste and
            extravagance, and applies money to the best advantage; frugality cuts
            off indulgences, and proceeds on a system of saving. The latter
            conveys the idea of not using or spending superfluously, and is
            opposed to lavishness or profusion. Frugality is usually applied to
            matters of consumption, and commonly points to simplicity of manners;
            parsimony is frugality carried to an extreme, involving meanness of
            spirit, and a sordid mode of living. Economy is a virtue, and
            parsimony a vice.</p>

            liberty and ease. Swift.<br>

             — Education, Instruction, Teaching, Training, Breeding. Education,
            properly a drawing forth, implies not so much the communication of
            knowledge as the discipline of the intellect, the establishment of
            the principles, and the regulation of the heart. Instruction is that
            part of education which furnishes the mind with knowledge. Teaching
            is the same, being simply more familiar. It is also applied to
            practice; as, teaching to speak a language; teaching a dog to do
            tricks. Training is a department of education in which the chief
            element is exercise or practice for the purpose of imparting facility
            in any physical or mental operation. Breeding commonly relates to the
            manners and outward conduct.</p>

            <p>Syn.
             — Effect, Consequence, Result. These words indicate things which
            arise out of some antecedent, or follow as a consequent. Effect,
            which may be regarded as the generic term, denotes that which springs
            directly from something which can properly be termed a cause. A
            consequence is more remote, not being strictly caused, nor yet a mere
            sequence, but following out of and following indirectly, or in the
            train of events, something on which it truly depends. A result is
            still more remote and variable, like the rebound of an elastic body
            which falls in very different directions. We may foresee the effects
            of a measure, may conjecture its consequences, but can rarely
            discover its final results.
            Resolving all events, with their effects And manifold results, into
            the will And arbitration wise of the Supreme. Cowper.
            Shun the bitter consequence, for know, The day thou eatest thereof, .

            the fact of direction in which involves polarity, or opposition of
            properties in opposite directions; also, by attraction for many
            substances, by a law involving attraction between surfaces of unlike
            polarity, and repulsion between those of like; by exhibiting
            accumulated polar tension when the circuit is broken; and by
            producing heat, light, concussion, and often chemical changes when
            the circuit passes between the poles or through any imperfectly
            conducting substance or space. It is generally brought into action by
            any disturbance of molecular equilibrium, whether from a chemical,
            physical, or mechanical, cause.</p>
            <p>Note: Electricity is manifested under following different forms: (a)
            Statical electricity, called also Frictional or Common, electricity,
            electricity in the condition of a stationary charge, in which the
            disturbance is produced by friction, as of glass, amber, etc., or by
            induction. (b) Dynamical electricity, called also Voltaic
            electricity, electricity in motion, or as a current produced by
            chemical decomposition, as by means of a voltaic battery, or by
            mechanical action, as by dynamo-electric machines. (c)
            Thermoelectricity, in which the disturbing cause is heat (attended
            possibly with some chemical action). It is developed by uniting two
            pieces of unlike metals in a bar, and then heating the bar unequally.
            (d) Atmospheric electricity, any condition of electrical disturbance
            in the atmosphere or clouds, due to some or all of the above
            mentioned causes. (e) Magnetic electricity, electricity developed by
            the action of magnets. (f) Positive electricity, the electricity that
            appears at the positive pole or anode of a battery, or that is
            produced by friction of glass; — called also vitreous electricity.
            (g) Negative electricity, the electricity that appears at the
            negative pole or cathode, or is produced by the friction of resinous
            substance; — called also resinous electricity. (h) Organic
            electricity, that which is developed in organic structures, either
            animal or vegetable, the phrase animal electricity being much more
            common.</p>

            <p>ELEMENT<br>
            El"e*ment, n. Etym: [F. élément, L. elementum.]
            </p>
            <p>1. One of the simplest or essential parts or principles of which
            anything consists, or upon which the constitution or fundamental
            powers of anything are based.</p>
            <p>2. One of the ultimate, undecomposable constituents of any kind of
            matter. Specifically: (Chem.) A substance which cannot be decomposed
            into different kinds of matter by any means at present employed; as,
            the elements of water are oxygen and hydrogen.</p>
            <p>Note: The elements are naturally classified in several families or
            groups, as the group of the alkaline elements, the halogen group, and
            the like. They are roughly divided into two great classes, the
            metals, as sodium, calcium, etc., which form basic compounds, and the
            nonmetals or metalloids, as oxygen, sulphur, chlorine, which form
            acid compounds; but the distinction is only relative, and some, as
            arsenic, tin, aluminium, etc., form both acid and basic compounds.
            The essential fact regarding every element is its relative atomic
            weight or equivalent. When the elements are tabulated in the order of
            their ascending atomic weights, the arrangement constitutes the
            series of the Periodic law of Mendelejeff. See Periodic law, under
            Periodic. This Periodic law enables us to predict the qualities of
            unknown elements. The number of elements known is about seventy-five,
            but the gaps in the Periodic law indicate the possibility of many
            more. Many of the elements with which we are familiar, as hydrogen,
            carbon, iron, gold, etc., have been recognized, by means of spectrum
            analysis, in the sun and the fixed stars. From certain evidence (as
            that afforded by the Periodic law, spectrum analysis, etc.) it
            appears that the chemical elements probably may not be simple bodies,
            but only very stable compounds of some simpler body or bodies. In
            formulas, the elements are designated by abbreviations of their names
            in Latin or New Latin.</p>

            <p>Note: Several other elements have been announced, as holmium,
            vesbium, austrium, etc., but their properties, and in some cases
            their existence, have not yet been definitely established.</p>
            <p>3. One of the ultimate parts which are variously combined in
            anything; as, letters are the elements of written language; hence,
            also, a simple portion of that which is complex, as a shaft, lever,
            wheel, or any simple part in a machine; one of the essential
            ingredients of any mixture; a constituent part; as, quartz, feldspar,
            and mica are the elements of granite.
            The simplicity which is so large an element in a noble nature was
            laughed to scorn. Jowett (Thucyd.).</p>
            <p>4.
            (a) One out of several parts combined in a system of aggregation,
            when each is of the nature of the whole; as, a single cell is an

            (a) An infinitesimal part of anything of the same nature as the
            entire magnitude considered; as, in a solid an element may be
            infinitesimal portion between any two planes that are separated and
            indefinitely small distance. In the calculus, element is sometimes
            used as synonymous with differential.
            (b) Sometimes a curve, or surface, or volume is considered as
            described by a moving point, or curve, or surface, the latter being
            at any instant called an element of the former.
            (c) One of the terms in an algebraic expression.</p>
            <p>7. One of the necessary data or values upon which a system of
            calculations depends, or general conclusions are based; as, the
            elements of a planet's orbit.</p>
            <p>8. pl.</p>
            <p>Defn: The simplest or fundamental principles of any system in

            <p>Defn: Any outline or sketch, regarded as containing the fundamental
            ideas or features of the thing in question; as, the elemental of a

            <p>10. One of the simple substances, as supposed by the ancient
            philosophers; one of the imaginary principles of matter.</p>
            <p>Note: (a) The four elements were, air, earth, water, and fire; whence

            for its existence.

            <p>EMBLEM
            Em"blem, n. Etym: [F. emblème, L. emblema, -atis, that which is put
            in or on, inlaid work, fr. Gr. In, and Parable.]</p>
            <p>1. Inlay; inlaid or mosaic work; something ornamental inserted in a
            surface. [Obs.] Milton.</p>
            <p>2. A visible sign of an idea; an object, or the figure of an object,
            symbolizing and suggesting another object, or an idea, by natural
            aptness or by association; a figurative representation; a typical
            designation; a symbol; as, a balance is an emblem of justice; a
            scepter, the emblem of sovereignty or power; a circle, the emblem of
            eternity. "His cicatrice, an emblem of war, here on his sinister
            cheek." Shak.</p>
            <p>3. A picture accompanied with a motto, a set of verse, or the like,
            intended as a moral lesson or meditation.</p>
            <p>Note: Writers and artists of the 17th century gave much attention and
            study to the composition of such emblems, and many collections of
            them were published.</p>
            <p>Syn.
             — Sign; symbol; type; device; signal; token.
             — Sign, Emblem, Symbol, Type. Sign is the generic word
            comprehending all significant representations. An emblem is a visible
            object representing another by a natural suggestion of characteristic
            qualities, or an habitual and recognized association; as, a circle,
            having no apparent beginning or end, is an emblem of eternity; a
            particular flag is the emblem of the country or ship which has
            adopted it for a sign and with which it is habitually associated.
            Between emblem and symbol the distinction is slight, and often one
            may be substituted for the other without impropriety. See Symbol.
            Thus, a circle is either an emblem or a symbol of eternity; a
            scepter, either an emblem or a symbol of authority; a lamb, either an
            emblem or a symbol of meekness. "An emblem is always of something
            simple; a symbol may be of something complex, as of a transaction . .
            . In consequence we do not speak of actions emblematic." C. J. Smith.
            A type is a representative example, or model, exhibiting the
            qualities common to all individuals of the class to which it belongs;
            as, the Monitor is a type of a class of war vessels.</p>

             — Competition; rivalry; contest; contention; strife.
             — Emulation, Competition, Rivalry. Competition is the struggle of
            two or more persons for the same object. Emulation is an ardent
            desire for superiority, arising from competition, but now implying,
            of necessity, any improper feeling. Rivalry is a personal contest,
            and, almost of course, has a selfish object and gives rise to envy.
            "Competition and emulation have honor for their basis; rivalry is but
            a desire for selfish gratification. Competition and emulation animate
            to effort; rivalry usually produces hatred. Competition and emulation
            seek to merit success; rivalry is contented with obtaining it."

            mass of each element of the body multiplied by the square of the
            velocity of the element, relative to some given body or point. The
            available kinetic energy of a material system unconnected with any
            other system is that energy which is due to the motions of the parts
            of the system relative to its center of mass. The potential energy of
            a body or system is that energy which is not kinetic; — energy due
            to configuration. Kinetic energy is sometimes called actual energy.
            Kinetic energy is exemplified in the vis viva of moving bodies, in
            heat, electric currents, etc.; potential energy, in a bent spring, or
            a body suspended a given distance above the earth and acted on by
            gravity.</p>

            En`gi*neer"ing, n.
            </p>
            <p>Defn: Originally, the art of managing engines; in its modern and
            extended sense, the art and science by which the mechanical
            properties of matter are made useful to man in structures and
            machines; the occupation and work of an engineer.</p>
            <p>Note: In a comprehensive sense, engineering includes architecture as
            a mechanical art, in distinction from architecture as a fine art. It
            was formerly divided into military engineering, which is the art of
            designing and constructing offensive and defensive works, and civil
            engineering, in a broad sense, as relating to other kinds of public
            works, machinery, etc.
             — Civil engineering, in modern usage, is strictly the art of
            planning, laying out, and constructing fixed public works, such as
            railroads, highways, canals, aqueducts, water works, bridges,
            lighthouses, docks, embankments, breakwaters, dams, tunnels, etc.
             — Mechanical engineering relates to machinery, such as steam
            engines, machine tools, mill work, etc.
             — Mining engineering deals with the excavation and working of
            mines, and the extraction of metals from their ores, etc. Engineering
            is further divided into steam engineering, gas engineering,
            agricultural engineering, topographical engineering, electrical
            engineering, etc.</p>

            <p>Note: The English language has been variously divided into periods by
            different writers. In the division most commonly recognized, the
            first period dates from about 450 to 1150. This is the period of full
            inflection, and is called Anglo-Saxon, or, by many recent writers,
            Old English. The second period dates from about 1150 to 1550 (or, if
            four periods be recognized, from about 1150 to 1350), and is called
            Early English, Middle English, or more commonly (as in the usage of
            this book), Old English. During this period most of the inflections
            were dropped, and there was a great addition of French words to the
            language. The third period extends from about 1350 to 1550, and is
            Middle English. During this period orthography became comparatively
            fixed. The last period, from about 1550, is called Modern English.</p>

            <p>Syn.
             — Epithet, Title. The name epithet was formerly extended to nouns
            which give a title or describe character (as the "epithet of liar"),
            but is now confined wholly to adjectives. Some rhetoricians, as
            Whately, restrict it still further, considering the term epithet as
            belonging only to a limited class of adjectives, viz., those which
            add nothing to the sense of their noun, but simply hold forth some
            quality necessarily implied therein; as, the bright sun, the lofty
            heavens, etc. But this restriction does not prevail in general
            literature. Epithet is sometimes confounded with application, which
            is always a noun or its equivalent.</p>

            results were effected, we should have called the times when these
            events happened epochs, and the whole period an epoch.

            Equity had been gradually shaping itself into a refined science which
            no human faculties could master without long and intense application.
            Macaulay.</p>
            <p>Note: Equitable jurisprudence in England and in the United States
            grew up from the inadequacy of common-law forms to secure justice in
            all cases; and this led to distinct courts by which equity was
            applied in the way of injunctions, bills of discovery, bills for
            specified performance, and other processes by which the merits of a
            case could be reached more summarily or more effectively than by
            common-law suits. By the recent English Judicature Act (1873),
            however, the English judges are bound to give effect, in common-law
            suits, to all equitable rights and remedies; and when the rules of
            equity and of common law, in any particular case, conflict, the rules
            of equity are to prevail. In many jurisdictions in the United States,
            equity and common law are thus blended; in others distinct equity
            tribunals are still maintained. See Chancery. Equity of redemption
            (Law), the advantage, allowed to a mortgageor, of a certain or
            reasonable time to redeem lands mortgaged, after they have been

            hydrochloric acid, their equivalents are 32.5 and 1. (b) The
            combining proportion by weight of a substance, or the number
            expressing this proportion, in any particular compound; as, the
            equivalents of hydrogen and oxygen in water are respectively 1 and 8,
            and in hydric dioxide 1 and 16.</p>
            <p>Note: This term was adopted by Wollaston to avoid using the
            conjectural expression atomic weight, with which, however, for a time
            it was practically synonymous. The attempt to limit the term to the
            meaning of a universally comparative combining weight failed, because
            of the possibility of several compounds of the substances by reason
            of the variation in combining power which most elements exhibit. The
            equivalent was really identical with, or a multiple of submultiple
            of, the atomic weight.</p>
            <p>3. (Chem.)</p>
            <p>Defn: A combining unit, whether an atom, a radical, or a molecule;
            as, in acid salt two or more equivalents of acid unite with one or
            more equivalents of base. Mechanical equivalent of heat (Physics),
            the number of units of work which the unit of heat can perform; the
            mechanical energy which must be expended to raise the temperature of
            a unit weight of water from 0º C. to 1º C., or from 32º F. to 33º F.
            The term was introduced by Dr. Mayer of Heilbronn. Its value was
            found by Joule to be 1390 foot pounds upon the Centigrade, or 772
            foot pounds upon the Fahrenheit, thermometric scale, whence it is
            often called Joule's equivalent, and represented by the symbol J.
            This is equal to 424 kilogram meters (Centigrade scale). A more
            recent determination by Professor Rowland gives the value 426.9
            kilogram meters, for the latitude of Baltimore.</p>

            <p>1. (Literally, called equally one thing or the other; hence:) Having
            two significations equally applicable; capable of double
            interpretation; of doubtful meaning; ambiguous; uncertain; as,
            equivocal words; an equivocal sentence.

            Milton.</p>
            <p>3. Uncertain, as an indication or sign; doubtful. "How equivocal a

            into several distinct keys; one whose intervals, being all minor
            thirds, do not clearly indicate its fundamental tone or root; the
            chord of the diminished triad, and the diminished seventh.</p>
            <p>Syn.
             — Ambiguous; doubtful; uncertain; indeterminate.
             — Equivocal, Ambiguous. We call an expression ambiguous when it has
            one general meaning, and yet contains certain words which may be
            taken in two different senses; or certain clauses which can be so
            connected with other clauses as to divide the mind between different
            views of part of the meaning intended. We call an expression
            equivocal when, taken as a whole, it conveys a given thought with
            perfect clearness and propriety, and also another thought with equal
            propriety and clearness. Such were the responses often given by the
            Delphic oracle; as that to Crambiguous is a mere blunder of language;
            what is equivocal is usually intended to deceive, though it may occur
            at times from mere inadvertence. Equivocation is applied only to
            cases where there is a design to deceive.</p>

            <p>3. The contrivance in a timepiece which connects the train of wheel
            work with the pendulum or balance, giving to the latter the impulse
            by which it is kept in vibration; — so called because it allows a
            tooth to escape from a pallet at each vibration.</p>
            <p>Note: Escapements are of several kinds, as the vertical, or verge, or
            crown, escapement, formerly used in watches, in which two pallets on
            the balance arbor engage with a crown wheel; the anchor escapement,
            in which an anchor-shaped piece carries the pallets; — used in
            common clocks (both are called recoil escapements, from the recoil of
            the escape wheel at each vibration); the cylinder escapement, having
            an open-sided hollow cylinder on the balance arbor to control the
            escape wheel; the duplex escapement, having two sets of teeth on the
            wheel; the lever escapement, which is a kind of detached escapement,
            because the pallets are on a lever so arranged that the balance which
            vibrates it is detached during the greater part of its vibration and
            thus swings more freely; the detent escapement, used in chronometers;
            the remontoir escapement, in which the escape wheel is driven by an
            independent spring or weight wound up at intervals by the clock
            train, — sometimes used in astronomical clocks. When the shape of an
            escape-wheel tooth is such that it falls dead on the pallet without
            recoil, it forms a deadbeat escapement.</p>

            <p>1. (Law)
            (a) (Feud. &amp; Eng. Law) The falling back or reversion of lands, by
            some casualty or accident, to the lord of the fee, in consequence of
            the extinction of the blood of the tenant, which may happen by his
            dying without heirs, and formerly might happen by corruption of
            blood, that is, by reason of a felony or attainder. Tomlins.
            Blackstone.
            (b) (U. S. Law) The reverting of real property to the State, as
            original and ultimate proprietor, by reason of a failure of persons
            legally entitled to hold the same.</p>
            <p>Note: A distinction is carefully made, by English writers, between
            escheat to the lord of the fee and forfeiture to the crown. But in
            this country, where the State holds the place of chief lord of the
            fee, and is entitled to take alike escheat and by forfeiture, this
            distinction is not essential. Tomlins. Kent.
            (c) A writ, now abolished, to recover escheats from the person in
            possession. Blackstone.</p>

            <p>Defn: To revert, or become forfeited, to the lord, the crown, or the
            State, as lands by the failure of persons entitled to hold the same,
            or by forfeiture.</p>
            <p>Note: In this country it is the general rule that when the title to
            land fails by defect of heirs or devisees, it necessarily escheats to
            the State; but forfeiture of estate from crime is hardly known in
            this country, and corruption of blood is universally abolished. Kent.

             — To Estimate, Esteem. Both these words imply an exercise of the
            judgment. Estimate has reference especially to the external relations
            of things, such as amount, magnitude, importance, etc. It usually
            involves computation or calculation; as, to estimate the loss or gain
            of an enterprise. Esteem has reference to the intrinsic or moral
            worth of a person or thing. Thus, we esteem a man for his kindness,
            or his uniform integrity. In this sense it implies a mingled
            sentiment of respect and attachment. We esteem it an honor to live in
            a free country. See Appreciate.</p>

            <p>Defn: A valuing or rating by the mind, without actually measuring,
            weighing, or the like; rough or approximate calculation; as, an

            pond.
            Weigh success in a moral balance, and our whole estimate is changed.
            J. C. Shairp.</p>
            <p>Syn.
             — Estimate, Estimation, Esteem. The noun estimate, like its verb,
            supposes chiefly an exercise of judgment in determining the amount,
            importance, or magnitude of things, with their other exterior
            relations; as, an estimate of expenses incurred; a true estimate of
            life, etc. Esteem is a moral sentiment made up of respect and
            attachment, — the valuation of a person as possessing useful
            qualities or real worth. Thus we speak of the esteem of the wise and
            good as a thing greatly to be desired. Estimation seems to waver
            between the two. In our version of the Scriptures it is used simply
            for estimate; as, "If he be poorer than thy estimation." Lev. xxvii.
            8. In other cases, it verges toward esteem; as, "I know him to be of
            worth and worthy estimation." Shak. It will probably settle down at
            last on this latter sense. "Esteem is the value we place upon some
            degree of worth. It is higher than simple approbation, which is a
            decision of judgment. It is the commencement of affection." Gogan.
            No; dear as freedom is, and in my heart's Just estimation prized
            above all price. Cowper.</p>

            <p>Syn.
             — Encomium; praise; panegyric; applause.
             — Eulogy, Eulogium, Encomium, Panegyric. The idea of praise is
            common to all these words. The word encomium is used of both persons
            and things which are the result of human action, and denotes warm
            praise. Eulogium and eulogy apply only to persons and are more
            studied and of greater length. A panegyric was originally a set
            speech in a full assembly of the people, and hence denotes a more
            formal eulogy, couched in terms of warm and continuous praise,
            especially as to personal character. We may bestow encomiums on any
            work of art, on production of genius, without reference to the
            performer; we bestow eulogies, or pronounce a eulogium, upon some
            individual distinguished for his merit public services; we pronounce
            a panegyric before an assembly gathered for the occasion.</p>

            <p>EVENT
            E*vent", n. Etym: [L. eventus, fr. evenire to happen, come out; e out
            + venire to come. See Come.]</p>
            <p>1. That which comes, arrives, or happens; that which falls out; any
            incident, good or bad. "The events of his early years." Macaulay.
            To watch quietly the course of events. Jowett (Thucyd. )
            There is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked. Eccl. ix. 2.</p>
            <p>2. An affair in hand; business; enterprise. [Obs.] "Leave we him to
            his events." Shak.</p>
            <p>3. The consequence of anything; the issue; conclusion; result; that
            in which an action, operation, or series of operations, terminates.
            Dark doubts between the promise and event. Young.</p>
            <p>Syn.
             — Incident; occurrence; adventure; issue; result; termination;
            consequence; conclusion.
             — Event, Occurrence, Incident, Circumstance. An event denotes that
            which arises from a preceding state of things. Hence we speak or
            watching the event; of tracing the progress of events. An occurrence
            has no reference to any antecedents, but simply marks that which
            meets us in our progress through life, as if by chance, or in the
            course of divine providence. The things which thus meet us, if
            important, are usually connected with antecedents; and hence event is
            the leading term. In the "Declaration of Independence" it is said,
            "When, in the cource of human events, it becomes necessary." etc.
            Here, occurrences would be out of place. An incident is that which
            falls into a state of things to which is does not primarily belong;
            as, the incidents of a journey. The term is usually applied to things
            of secondary importance. A circumstance is one of the things
            surrounding us in our path of life. These may differ greatly in
            importance; but they are always outsiders, which operate upon us from
            without, exerting greater or less influence according to their
            intrinsic importance. A person giving an account of a campaign might
            dwell on the leading events which it produced; might mention some of
            its striking occurrences; might allude to some remarkable incidents
            which attended it; and might give the details of the favorable or
            adverse circumstances which marked its progress.</p>

            <p>5. An instance serving for illustration of a rule or precept,
            especially a problem to be solved, or a case to be determined, as an

            science; as, in trigonometry and grammar, the principles and rules
            are illustrated by examples.</p>
            <p>Syn.
             — Precedent; case; instance.
             — Example, Instance. The discrimination to be made between these
            two words relates to cases in which we give "instances" or "examples"
            of things done. An instance denotes the single case then "standing"
            before us; if there be others like it, the word does not express this
            fact. On the contrary, an example is one of an entire class of like
            things, and should be a true representative or sample of that class.
            Hence, an example proves a rule or regular course of things; an
            instance simply points out what may be true only in the case
            presented. A man's life may be filled up with examples of the self-
            command and kindness which marked his character, and may present only
            a solitary instance of haste or severity. Hence, the word "example"
            should never be used to describe what stands singly and alone. We do,
            however, sometimes apply the word instance to what is really an
            example, because we are not thinking of the latter under this aspect,
            but solely as a case which "stands before us." See Precedent.</p>

             — Except, Excepting, But, Save, Besides. Excepting, except, but,
            and save are exclusive. Except marks exclusion more pointedly. "I
            have finished all the letters except one," is more marked than "I
            have finished all the letters but one." Excepting is the same as
            except, but less used. Save is chiefly found in poetry. Besides
            (lit., by the side of) is in the nature of addition. "There is no one
            here except or but him," means, take him away and there is nobody
            present. "There is nobody here besides him," means, hi is present and
            by the side of, or in addition to, him is nobody. "Few ladies, except
            her Majesty, could have made themselves heard." In this example,
            besides should be used, not except.</p>

            another, as the value of the pound sterling in the currency of France
            or the United States. The par of exchange rarely varies, and serves
            as a measure for the rise and fall of exchange that is affected by
            the demand and supply. Exchange is at par when, for example, a bill
            in New York, for the payment of one hundred pounds sterling in
            London, can be purchased for the sum. Exchange is in favor of a place

            department, it had jurisdiction over the proprietary rights of the
            crown against subjects; in the common law department, it administered
            justice in personal actions between subject and subject. A person
            proceeding against another in the revenue department was said to
            exchequer him. The judges of this court were one chief and four
            puisne barons, so styled. The Court of Exchequer Chamber sat as court
            of error in which the judgments of each of the superior courts of
            common law, in England, were subject to revision by the judges of the
            other two sitting collectively. Causes involving difficult questions
            of law were sometimes after argument, adjourned into this court from
            the other courts, for debate before judgment in the court below.
            Recent legislation in England (1880) has abolished the Court of
            Exchequer and the Court of Exchequer Chamber, as distinct tribunals,
            a single board of judiciary, the High Court of Justice, being
            established for the trial of all classes of civil cases. Wharton.</p>

            spectare to look at. See Spectacle.]
            </p>
            <p>1. To wait for; to await. [Obs.]
            Let's in, and there expect their coming. Shak.</p>
            <p>2. To look for (mentally); to look forward to, as to something that
            is believed to be about to happen or come; to have a previous
            apprehension of, whether of good or evil; to look for with some
            confidence; to anticipate; — often followed by an infinitive,
            sometimes by a clause (with, or without, that); as I expect to
            receive wages; I expect that the troops will be defeated. "Good: I
            will expect you." Shak. "Expecting thy reply." Shak.

             — To anticipate; look for; await; hope.
             — To Expect, Think, Believe, Await. Expect is a mental act and has
            aways a reference to the future, to some coming event; as a person
            expects to die, or he expects to survive. Think and believe have
            reference to the past and present, as well as to the future; as I
            think the mail has arrived; I believe he came home yesterday, that he
            is he is at home now. There is a not uncommon use of expect, which is
            a confusion of the two; as, I expect the mail has arrived; I expect
            he is at home. This misuse should be avoided. Await is a physical or
            moral act. We await that which, when it comes, will affect us
            personally. We expect what may, or may not, interest us personally.

            the two eyes, Skr. akshi. Diasy, Ocular, Optic, Eyelet, Ogle.]</p>
            <p>1. The organ of sight or vision. In man, and the vertebrates
            generally, it is properly the movable ball or globe in the orbit, but
            the term often includes the adjacent parts. In most invertebrates the
            years are immovable ocelli, or compound eyes made up of numerous
            ocelli. See Ocellus. Description of illustration: a b Conjunctiva; c
            Cornea; d Sclerotic; e Choroid; f Cillary Muscle; g Cillary Process;
            h Iris; i Suspensory Ligament; k Prosterior Aqueous Chamber between h
            and i; l Anterior Aqueous Chamber; m Crystalline Lens; n Vitreous
            Humor; o Retina; p Yellow spot; q Center of blind spot; r Artery of
            Retina in center of the Optic Nerve.</p>
            <p>Note: The essential parts of the eye are inclosed in a tough outer
            coat, the sclerotic, to which the muscles moving it are attached, and
            which in front changes into the transparent cornea. A little way back
            of cornea, the crystalline lens is suspended, dividing the eye into
            two unequal cavities, a smaller one in front filled with a watery
            fluid, the aqueous humor, and larger one behind filled with a clear
            jelly, the vitreous humor. The sclerotic is lined with a highly
            pigmented membrane, the choroid, and this is turn is lined in the
            back half of the eyeball with the nearly transparent retina, in which
            the fibers of the optic nerve ramify. The choroid in front is
            continuous with the iris, which has a contractile opening in the
            center, the pupil, admitting light to the lens which brings the rays
            to a focus and forms an image upon the retina, where the light,
            falling upon delicate structures called rods and cones, causes them
            to stimulate the fibres of the optic nerve to transmit visual
            impressions to the brain.</p>
            <p>2. The faculty of seeing; power or range of vision; hence, judgment
            or taste in the use of the eye, and in judging of objects; as, to
            have the eye of sailor; an eye for the beautiful or picturesque.</p>
            <p>3. The action of the organ of sight; sight, look; view; ocular
            knowledge; judgment; opinion.
            In my eye, she is the sweetest lady that I looked on. Shak.</p>
            <p>4. The space commanded by the organ of sight; scope of vision; hence,
            face; front; the presence of an object which is directly opposed or
            confronted; immediate presence.
            We shell express our duty in his eye. Shak.
            Her shell your hear disproved to her eyes. Shak.</p>
            <p>5. Observation; oversight; watch; inspection; notice; attention;
            regard. "Keep eyes upon her." Shak.

            (b) The scar to which the adductor muscle is attached in oysters and

            used as food, as in the scallop.
            (c) The bud or sprout of a plant or tuber; as the eye of a potato.
