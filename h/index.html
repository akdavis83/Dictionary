            <h2><a id="chap08"></a>H</h2>
            <p>Defn: the eighth letter of the English alphabet, is classed among the
            consonants, and is formed with the mouth organs in the same position
            as that of the succeeding vowel. It is used with certain consonants
            to form digraphs representing sounds which are not found in the
            alphabet, as sh, th, th, as in shall, thing, thine (for zh see §274);
            also, to modify the sounds of some other letters, as when placed
            after c and p, with the former of which it represents a compound
            sound like that of tsh, as in charm (written also tch as in catch),
            with the latter, the sound of f, as in phase, phantom. In some words,
            mostly derived or introduced from foreign languages, h following c
            and g indicates that those consonants have the hard sound before e,
            i, and y, as in chemistry, chiromancy, chyle, Ghent, Ghibelline,
            etc.; in some others, ch has the sound of sh, as in chicane. See
            Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 153, 179, 181-3, 237-8.</p>
            <p>Note: The name (aitch) is from the French ache; its form is from the
            Latin, and this from the Greek H, which was used as the sign of the
            spiritus asper (rough breathing) before it came to represent the long
            vowel, Gr. ê. The Greek H is from Phoenician, the ultimate origin
            probably being Egyptian. Etymologically H is most closely related to
            c; as in E. horn, L. cornu, Gr. ke`ras; E. hele, v. t., conceal; E.
            hide, L. cutis, Gr. ky`tos; E. hundred, L. centum, Gr. 'e-kat-on,
            Skr. csata. H piece (Mining), the part of a plunger pump which
            contains the valve.</p>

            uttered and as written, it expresses a great variety of emotions,
            determined by the tone or the context. When repeated, ha, ha, it is
            an expression of laughter, satisfaction, or triumph, sometimes of
            derisive laughter; or sometimes it is equivalent to "Well, it is so."

             — Practice; mode; manner; way; custom; fashion.
             — Habit, Custom. Habit is a disposition or tendency leading us to
            do easily, naturally, and with growing certainty, what we do often;
            custom is external, being habitual use or the frequent repetition of
            the same act. The two operate reciprocally on each other. The custom
            of giving produces a habit of liberality; habits of devotion promote
            the custom of going to church. Custom also supposes an act of the
            will, selecting given modes of procedure; habit is a law of our
            being, a kind of "second nature" which grows up within us.
            How use doth breed a habit in a man ! Shak.

            To do the handsome thing, to act liberally. [Colloq.]</p>
            <p>Syn.
             — Handsome, Pretty. Pretty applies to things comparatively small,
            which please by their delicacy and grace; as, a pretty girl, a pretty
            flower, a pretty cottage. Handsome rises higher, and is applied to
            objects on a larger scale. We admire what is handsome, we are pleased
            with what is pretty. The word is connected with hand, and has thus
            acquired the idea of training, cultivation, symmetry, and proportion,
            which enters so largely into our conception of handsome. Thus Drayton
            makes mention of handsome players, meaning those, who are well
            trained; and hence we speak of a man's having a handsome address,
            which is the result of culture; of a handsome horse or dog, which
            implies well proportioned limbs; of a handsome face, to which, among
            other qualities, the idea of proportion and a graceful contour are
            essential; of a handsome tree, and a handsome house or villa. So,
            from this idea of proportion or suitableness, we have, with a
            different application, the expressions, a handsome fortune, a
            handsome offer.</p>

            <p>Syn.
             — To Hate, Abhor, Detest, Abominate, Loathe. Hate is the generic
            word, and implies that one is inflamed with extreme dislike. We abhor
            what is deeply repugnant to our sensibilities or feelings. We detest
            what contradicts so utterly our principles and moral sentiments that
            we feel bound to lift up our voice against it. What we abominate does
            equal violence to our moral and religious sentiments. What we loathe
            is offensive to our own nature, and excites unmingled disgust. Our
            Savior is said to have hated the deeds of the Nicolaitanes; his
            language shows that he loathed the lukewarmness of the Laodiceans; he
            detested the hypocrisy of the scribes and Pharisees; he abhorred the
            suggestions of the tempter in the wilderness.</p>

            <p>1. (Anat.)</p>
            <p>Defn: A hollow, muscular organ, which, by contracting rhythmically,
            keeps up the circulation of the blood.
            Why does my blood thus muster to my heart! Shak.</p>
            <p>Note: In adult mammals and birds, the heart is four-chambered, the
            right auricle and ventricle being completely separated from the left
            auricle and ventricle; and the blood flows from the systematic veins
            to the right auricle, thence to the right ventricle, from which it is
            forced to the lungs, then returned to the left auricle, thence passes
            to the left ventricle, from which it is driven into the systematic
            arteries. See Illust. under Aorta. In fishes there are but one
            auricle and one ventricle, the blood being pumped from the ventricle
            through the gills to the system, and thence returned to the auricle.
            In most amphibians and reptiles, the separation of the auricles is
            partial or complete, and in reptiles the ventricles also are
            separated more or less completely. The so-called lymph hearts, found
            in many amphibians, reptiles, and birds, are contractile sacs, which
            pump the lymph into the veins.</p>
            <p>2. The seat of the affections or sensibilities, collectively or
            separately, as love, hate, joy, grief, courage, and the like; rarely,
            the seat of the understanding or will; — usually in a good sense,
            when no epithet is expressed; the better or lovelier part of our
            nature; the spring of all our actions and purposes; the seat of moral
            life and character; the moral affections and character itself; the
            individual disposition and character; as, a good, tender, loving,
            bad, hard, or selfish heart.
            Hearts are dust, hearts' loves remain. Emerson.</p>
            <p>3. The nearest the middle or center; the part most hidden and within;
            the inmost or most essential part of any body or system; the source
            of life and motion in any organization; the chief or vital portion;
            the center of activity, or of energetic or efficient action; as, the
            heart of a country, of a tree, etc.
            Exploits done in the heart of France. Shak.

            <p>5. Vigorous and efficient activity; power of fertile production;
            condition of the soil, whether good or bad.
            That the spent earth may gather heart again. Dryden.</p>
            <p>6. That which resembles a heart in shape; especially, a roundish or
            oval figure or object having an obtuse point at one end, and at the
            other a corresponding indentation, — used as a symbol or
            representative of the heart.</p>
            <p>7. One of a series of playing cards, distinguished by the figure or
            figures of a heart; as, hearts are trumps.</p>
            <p>8. Vital part; secret meaning; real intention.
            And then show you the heart of my message. Shak.</p>
            <p>9. A term of affectionate or kindly and familiar address. "I speak to
            thee, my heart." Shak.</p>
            <p>Note: Heart is used in many compounds, the most of which need no<br>
            special explanation; as, heart-appalling, heart-breaking, heart-<br>

            <p>Syn.
             — To aid; assist; succor; relieve; serve; support; sustain;
            befriend.
             — To Help, Aid, Assist. These words all agree in the idea of
            affording relief or support to a person under difficulties. Help
            turns attention especially to the source of relief. If I fall into a
            pit, I call for help; and he who helps me out does it by an act of
            his own. Aid turns attention to the other side, and supposes
            coöperation on the part of him who is relieved; as, he aided me in
            getting out of the pit; I got out by the aid of a ladder which he
            brought. Assist has a primary reference to relief afforded by a
            person who "stands by" in order to relieve. It denotes both help and
            aid. Thus, we say of a person who is weak, I assisted him upstairs,
            or, he mounted the stairs by my assistance. When help is used as a
            noun, it points less distinctively and exclusively to the source of
            relief, or, in other words, agrees more closely with aid. Thus we
            say, I got out of a pit by the help of my friend.</p>

            doctrinal, and usually of a malignant character, tending to subvert
            the true faith. A schismatic is one who creates a schism, or division
            in the church, on points of faith, discipline, practice, etc.,
            usually for the sake of personal aggrandizement. A sectarian is one

            distinct organization, which separates from the main body of
            believers.</p>

            <p>Syn.
             — Heroism, Courage, Fortitude, Bravery, Valor, Intrepidity,
            Gallantry. Courage is generic, denoting fearlessness or defiance of
            danger; fortitude is passive courage, the habit of bearing up nobly
            under trials, danger, and sufferings; bravery is courage displayed in
            daring acts; valor is courage in battle or other conflicts with
            living opponents; intrepidity is firm courage, which shrinks not amid
            the most appalling dangers; gallantry is adventurous courage, dashing
            into the thickest of the fight. Heroism may call into exercise all
            these modifications of courage. It is a contempt of danger, not from
            ignorance or inconsiderate levity, but from a noble devotion to some
            great cause, and a just confidence of being able to meet danger in
            the spirit of such a cause. Cf. Courage.</p>

            Hieratic character, a mode of ancient Egyptian writing; a modified

            It was a false notion of the Greeks that of the three kinds of
            writing used by the Egyptians, two — for that reason called
            hieroglyphic and hieratic — were employed only for sacred, while the
            third, the demotic, was employed for secular, purposes. No such

            picture writing of the ancient Egyptian priests. It is made up of
            three, or, as some say, four classes of characters: first, the
            hieroglyphic proper, or figurative, in which the representation of
            the object conveys the idea of the object itself; second, the
            ideographic, consisting of symbols representing ideas, not sounds, as
            an ostrich feather is a symbol of truth; third, the phonetic,
            consisting of symbols employed as syllables of a word, or as letters
            of the alphabet, having a certain sound, as a hawk represented the
            vowel a.</p>

            <p>Defn: A day fixed by law for suspension of business; a legal holiday.</p>
            <p>Note: In the United States legal holidays, so called, are determined
            by law, commonly by the statutes of the several States. The holidays
            most generally observed are: the 22d day of February (Washington's
            birthday), the 30th day of May (Memorial day), the 4th day of July
            (Independence day), the 25th day of December (Christmas day). In most
            of the States the 1st day of January is a holiday. When any of these
            days falls on Sunday, usually the Monday following is observed as the
            holiday. In many of the States a day in the spring (as Good Friday,
            or the first Thursday in April), and a day in the fall (as the last
            Thursday in November) are now regularly appointed by Executive
            proclamation to be observed, the former as a day of fasting and
            prayer, the latter as a day of thanksgiving and are kept as holidays.
            In England, the days of the greater church feasts (designated in the
            calendar by a red letter, and commonly called red-letter days) are
            observed as general holidays. Bank holidays are those on which, by
            act of Parliament, banks may suspend business. Although Sunday is a
            holiday in the sense of a day when business is legally suspended, it
            is not usually included in the general term, the phrase "Sundays and
            holidays" being more common. The holidays, any fixed or usual period
            for relaxation or festivity; especially, Christmas and New Year's day
            with the intervening time.</p>

            </p>
            <p>1. (Zoöl.)</p>
            <p>Defn: A hoofed quadruped of the genus Equus; especially, the domestic
            horse (E. caballus), which was domesticated in Egypt and Asia at a
            very early period. It has six broad molars, on each side of each jaw,
            with six incisors, and two canine teeth, both above and below. The
            mares usually have the canine teeth rudimentary or wanting. The horse
            differs from the true asses, in having a long, flowing mane, and the
            tail bushy to the base. Unlike the asses it has callosities, or
            chestnuts, on all its legs. The horse excels in strength, speed,
            docility, courage, and nobleness of character, and is used for
            drawing, carrying, bearing a rider, and like purposes.</p>
            <p>Note: Many varieties, differing in form, size, color, gait, speed,
            etc., are known, but all are believed to have been derived from the
            same original species. It is supposed to have been a native of the
            plains of Central Asia, but the wild species from which it was
            derived is not certainly known. The feral horses of America are
            domestic horses that have run wild; and it is probably true that most
            of those of Asia have a similar origin. Some of the true wild Asiatic
            horses do, however, approach the domestic horse in several
            characteristics. Several species of fossil (Equus) are known from the
            later Tertiary formations of Europe and America. The fossil species
            of other genera of the family Equidæ are also often called horses, in
            general sense.</p>

            male; usually, a castrated male.</p>

            made to ride for punishment.</p>
            <p>6. Anything, actual or figurative, on which one rides as on a horse;
            a hobby.</p>
            <p>7. (Mining)</p>
            <p>Defn: A mass of earthy matter, or rock of the same character as the
            wall rock, occurring in the course of a vein, as of coal or ore;
            hence, to take horse — said of a vein — is to divide into branches

            a better way. Dryden.</p>
            <p>Syn.
             — However, At least, Nevertheless, Yet. These words, as here
            compared, have an adversative sense in reference to something
            referred to in the context. However is the most general, and leads to
            a final conclusion or decision. Thus we say, the truth, however, has
            not yet fully come out; i.e., such is the speaker's conclusion in
            view of the whole case. So also we say, however, you may rely on my
            assistance to that amount; i. e., at all events, whatever may happen,
            this is my final decision. At least is adversative in another way. It
            points out the utmost concession that can possibly be required, and
            still marks the adversative conclusion; as, at least, this must be
            done; whatever may be our love of peace, we must at least maintain
            the rights of conscience. Nevertheless denotes that though the
            concession be fully made, it has no bearing of the question; as,
            nevertheless, we must go forward. Yet signifies that however extreme
            the supposition or fact comceded may be, the consequence which might
            naturally be expected does not and will not follow; as, though I
            should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee; though he slay me,
            yet will I trust in him. Cf. But.</p>

            <p>Syn.
             — Lowliness; humbleness; meekness; modesty; diffidence.
             — Humility, Modesty, Diffidence. Diffidence is a distrust of our
            powers, combined with a fear lest our failure should be censured,
            since a dread of failure unconnected with a dread of censure is not
            usually called diffidence. It may be carried too far, and is not
            always, like modesty and humility, a virtue. Modesty, without
            supposing self-distrust, implies an unwillingness to put ourselves
            forward, and an absence of all over-confidence in our own powers.
            Humility consists in rating our claims low, in being willing to waive
            our rights, and take a lower place than might be our due. It does not
            require of us to underrate ourselves.</p>

            acids, the base which is replaced by metals and basic radicals to
            form salts. Like all other gases, it is condensed by great cold and
            pressure to a liquid which freezes and solidifies by its own
            evaporation. It is absorbed in large quantities by certain metals
            (esp. palladium), forming alloy-like compounds; hence, in view of
            quasi-metallic nature, it is sometimes called hydrogenium. It is the
            typical reducing agent, as opposed to oxidizers, as oxygen, chlorine,
            etc. Bicarbureted hydrogen, an old name for ethylene.

            manufactured in large quantities for an oxidizing and bleaching
            agent. Called also oxygenated water.
             — Hydrogen oxide, a chemical name for water, H — Hydrogen
            sulphide, a colorless inflammable gas, H2S, having the characteristic
