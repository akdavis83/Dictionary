            R (är).</h2>
            <p>Defn: R, the eighteenth letter of the English alphabet, is a vocal
            consonant.  It is sometimes called a semivowel, and a liquid. See
            Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 178, 179, and 250-254. "R is the dog's
            letter and hurreth in the sound."  B. Jonson.</p>
            <p>In words derived from the Greek language the letter h is generally
            written after r to represent the aspirated sound of the Greek "r, but
            does not affect the pronunciation of the English word, as rhapsody,
            rhetoric.</p>
            <p>The English letter derives its form from the Greek through the Latin,
            the Greek letter being derived from the Phonician, which, it is
            believed, is ultimately of Egyptian origin. Etymologically, R is most
            closely related to l, s, and n; as in bandore, mandole; purple, L.
            purpura; E. chapter, F. chapitre, L. capitulum; E. was, were; hare,
            G. hase; E. order, F. ordre, L. ordo, ordinis; E. coffer, coffin.</p>

             — Spicy; spirited; lively; smart; piquant.
             — Racy, Spicy. Racy refers primarily to that peculiar flavor which
            certain wines are supposed to derive from the soil in which the
            grapes were grown; and hence we call a style or production racy when
            it "smacks of the soil," or has an uncommon degree of natural
            freshness and distinctiveness of thought and language. Spicy, when
            applied, has reference to a spirit and pungency added by art,
            seasoning the matter like a condiment. It does not, like racy,
            suggest native peculiarity. A spicy article in a magazine; a spicy
            retort. Racy in conversation; a racy remark.
            Rich, racy verses, in which we The soil from which they come, taste,

             — Radical pitch, the pitch or tone with which the utterance of a
            syllable begins. Rush.
             — Radical quantity (Alg.), a quantity to which the radical sign is
            prefixed; specifically, a quantity which is not a perfect power of
            the degree indicated by the radical sign; a surd.
             — Radical sign (Math.), the sign sq. root (originally the letter r,
            the initial of radix, root), placed before any quantity, denoting
            that its root is to be extracted; thus, sq. roota, or sq. root(a +
            b). To indicate any other than the square root, a corresponding
            figure is placed over the sign; thus cube roota, indicates the third
            or cube root of a.

             — Primitive; original; natural; underived; fundamental; entire.
             — Radical, Entire. These words are frequently employed as
            interchangeable in describing some marked alternation in the
            condition of things. There is, however, an obvious difference between
            them. A radical cure, reform, etc., is one which goes to the root of
            the thing in question; and it is entire, in the sense that, by
            affecting the root, it affects in a appropriate degree the entire
            body nourished by the root; but it may not be entire in the sense of
            making a change complete in its nature, as well as in its extent.
            Hence, we speak of a radical change; a radical improvement; radical
            differences of opinion; while an entire change, an entire
            improvement, an entire difference of opinion, might indicate more
            than was actually intended. A certain change may be both radical and
            entire, in every sense.</p>

            The words we at present make use of, and understand only by common

            (b) Specifically, a group of two or more atoms, not completely
            saturated, which are so linked that their union implies certain

            <p>RADIUM<br>
            Ra`di*um, n. [NL., fr. L. radius ray.] (Chem.)
            </p>
            <p>Defn: An intensely radioactive metallic element found (combined) in
            minute quantities in pitchblende, and various other uranium minerals.
            Symbol, Ra; atomic weight, 226.4. Radium was discovered by M. and
            Mme. Curie, of Paris, who in 1902 separated compounds of it by a
            tedious process from pitchblende. Its compounds color flames carmine
            and give a characteristic spectrum. It resembles barium chemically.
            Radium preparations are remarkable for maintaining themselves at a
            higher temperature than their surroundings, and for their radiations,
            which are of three kinds: alpha rays, beta rays, and gamma rays (see
            these terms). By reason of these rays they ionize gases, affect
            photographic plates, cause sores on the skin, and produce many other
            striking effects. Their degree of activity depends on the proportion
            of radium present, but not on its state of chemical combination or on
            external conditions.The radioactivity of radium is therefore an
            atomic property, and is explained as result from a disintegration of
            the atom. This breaking up occurs in at least seven stages; the
            successive main products have been studied and are called radium
            emanation or exradio, radium A, radium B, radium C, etc. (The
            emanation is a heavy gas, the later products are solids.) These
            products are regarded as unstable elements, each with an atomic
            weight a little lower than its predecessor. It is possible that lead
            is the stable end product. At the same time the light gas helium is
            formed; it probably consists of the expelled alpha particles. The
            heat effect mentioned above is ascribed to the impacts of these
            particles. Radium, in turn, is believed to be formed indirectly by an
            immeasurably slow disintegration of uranium.</p>

            <p>Syn.
             — Bulwark; fence; security; guard.
             — Rampart, Bulwark. These words were formerly interchanged; but in
            modern usage a distinction has sprung up between them. The rampart of
            a fortified place is the enceinte or main embankment or wall which
            surrounds it. The term bulwark is now applied to peculiarly strong
            outworks which project for the defense of the rampart, or main work.
            A single bastion is a bulwark. In using these words figuratively,
            rampart is properly applied to that which protects by walling out;
            bulwark to that which stands in the forefront of danger, to meet and
            repel it. Hence, we speak of a distinguished individual as the
            bulwark, not the rampart, of the state. This distinction, however, is
            often disregarded.</p>

             — Real, Actual. Real represents a thing to be a substantive
            existence; as, a real, not imaginary, occurrence. Actual refers to it
            as acted or performed; and, hence, when we wish to prove a thing
            real, we often say, "It actually exists," "It has actually been
            done." Thus its really is shown by its actually. Actual, from this
            reference to being acted, has recently received a new signification,
            namely, present; as, the actual posture of affairs; since what is now
            in action, or going on, has, of course, a present existence. An

            wickedness. Tillotson.</p>
            <p>2. The faculty of capacity of the human mind by which it is
            distinguished from the intelligence of the inferior animals; the
            higher as distinguished from the lower cognitive faculties, sense,
            imagination, and memory, and in contrast to the feelings and desires.
            Reason comprises conception, judgment, reasoning, and the intuitional
            faculty. Specifically, it is the intuitional faculty, or the faculty
            of first truths, as distinguished from the understanding, which is
            called the discursive or ratiocinative faculty.
            We have no other faculties of perceiving or knowing anything divine
            or human, but by our five senses and our reason. P. Browne.
            In common and popular discourse, reason denotes that power by which
            we distinguish truth from falsehood, and right from wrong, and by
            which we are enabled to combine means for the attainment of
            particular ends. Stewart.
            Reason is used sometimes to express the whole of those powers which
            elevate man above the brutes, and constitute his rational nature,
            more especially, perhaps, his intellectual powers; sometimes to
            express the power of deduction or argumentation. Stewart.
            By the pure reason I mean the power by which we become possessed of
            principles. Coleridge.
            The sense perceives; the understanding, in its own peculiar
            operation, conceives; the reason, or rationalized understanding,
            comprehends. Coleridge.</p>
            <p>3. Due exercise of the reasoning faculty; accordance with, or that
            which is accordant with and ratified by, the mind rightly exercised;
            right intellectual judgment; clear and fair deductions from true
            principles; that which is dictated or supported by the common sense
            of mankind; right conduct; right; propriety; justice.
            I was promised, on a time, To have reason for my rhyme. Spenser.
            But law in a free nation hath been ever public reason; the enacted
            reason of a parliament, which he denying to enact, denies to govern
            us by that which ought to be our law; interposing his own private
            reason, which to us is no law. Milton.
            The most probable way of bringing France to reason would be by the
            making an attempt on the Spanish West Indies. Addison.</p>

            reason, in justice; with rational ground; in a right view.
            When anything is proved by as good arguments as a thing of that kind
            is capable of, we ought not, in reason, to doubt of its existence.
            Tillotson.
            — It is reason, it is reasonable; it is right. [Obs.]
            Yet it were great reason, that those that have children should have

            <p>2. That which is offered in argument; proofs or reasons when arranged

            His reasoning was sufficiently profound. Macaulay.</p>
            <p>Syn.
             — Argumentation; argument.
             — Reasoning, Argumentation. Few words are more interchanged than
            these; and yet, technically, there is a difference between them.
            Reasoning is the broader term, including both deduction and
            induction. Argumentation denotes simply the former, and descends from
            the whole to some included part; while reasoning embraces also the
            latter, and ascends from a part to a whole. See Induction. Reasoning
            is occupied with ideas and their relations; argumentation has to do
            with the forms of logic. A thesis is set down: you attack, I defend
            it; you insist, I prove; you distinguish, I destroy your
            distinctions; my replies balance or overturn your objections. Such is
            argumentation. It supposes that there are two sides, and that both
            agree to the same rules. Reasoning, on the other hand, is often a
            natural process, by which we form, from the general analogy of
            nature, or special presumptions in the case, conclusions which have
            greater or less degrees of force, and which may be strengthened or
            weakened by subsequent experience.</p>

            <p>Defn: Reflexive; — applied to pronouns and verbs, but sometimes

            <p>5. (Math.)</p>
            <p>Defn: Used to denote different kinds of mutual relation; often with
            reference to the substitution of reciprocals for given quantities.
            See the Phrases below. Reciprocal equation (Math.), one which remains
            unchanged in form when the reciprocal of the unknown quantity is
            substituted for that quantity.
             — Reciprocal figures (Geom.), two figures of the same kind (as
            triangles, parallelograms, prisms, etc.), so related that two sides
            of the one form the extremes of a proportion of which the means are
            the two corresponding sides of the other; in general, two figures so
            related that the first corresponds in some special way to the second,
            and the second corresponds in the same way to the first.
             — Reciprocal proportion (Math.), a proportion such that, of four
            terms taken in order, the first has to the second the same ratio
            which the fourth has to the third, or the first has to the second the
            same ratio which the reciprocal of the third has to the reciprocal of
            the fourth. Thus, 2:5: :20:8 form a reciprocal proportion, because
            2:5: :1/20:1/8.
             — Reciprocal quantities (Math.), any two quantities which produce
            unity when multiplied together.
             — Reciprocal ratio (Math.), the ratio between the reciprocals of
            two quantities; as, the reciprocal ratio of 4 to 9 is that of ¼ to
            1/9.
             — Reciprocal terms (Logic), those terms which have the same
            signification, and, consequently, are convertible, and may be used
            for each other.</p>
            <p>Syn.
             — Mutual; alternate.
             — Reciprocal, Mutual. The distinctive idea of mutual is, that the
            parties unite by interchange in the same act; as, a mutual covenant;
            mutual affection, etc. The distinctive idea of reciprocal is, that
            one party acts by way of return or response to something previously
            done by the other party; as, a reciprocal kindness; reciprocal
            reproaches, etc. Love is reciprocal when the previous affection of
            one party has drawn forth the attachment of the other. To make it
            mutual in the strictest sense, the two parties should have fallen in
            love at the same time; but as the result is the same, the two words
            are here used interchangeably. The ebbing and flowing of the tide is
            a case where the action is reciprocal, but not mutual.</p>

             — Reformation, Reform. Reformation is a more thorough and

            more important, and results in changes which are more lasting. A
            reformation involves, and is followed by, many particular reforms.

            <p>1. The act of refracting, or the state of being refracted.</p>
            <p>2. The change in the direction of ray of light, heat, or the like,
            when it enters obliquely a medium of a different density from that
            through which it has previously moved.
            Refraction out of the rarer medium into the denser, is made towards
            the perpendicular. Sir I. Newton.</p>
            <p>3. (Astron.)
            (a) The change in the direction of a ray of light, and, consequently,
            in the apparent position of a heavenly body from which it emanates,
            arising from its passage through the earth's atmosphere; — hence
            distinguished as atmospheric refraction, or astronomical refraction.
            (b) The correction which is to be deducted from the apparent altitude
            of a heavenly body on account of atmospheric refraction, in order to
            obtain the true altitude. Angle of refraction (Opt.), the angle which
            a refracted ray makes with the perpendicular to the surface
            separating the two media traversed by the ray.
             — Conical refraction (Opt.), the refraction of a ray of light into
            an infinite number of rays, forming a hollow cone. This occurs when a
            ray of light is passed through crystals of some substances, under
            certain circumstances. Conical refraction is of two kinds; external
            conical refraction, in which the ray issues from the crystal in the
            form of a cone, the vertex of which is at the point of emergence; and
            internal conical refraction, in which the ray is changed into the
            form of a cone on entering the crystal, from which it issues in the
            form of a hollow cylinder. This singular phenomenon was first
            discovered by Sir W. R. Hamilton by mathematical reasoning alone,
            unaided by experiment.
             — Differential refraction (Astron.), the change of the apparent
            place of one object relative to a second object near it, due to
            refraction; also, the correction required to be made to the observed
            relative places of the two bodies.
             — Double refraction (Opt.), the refraction of light in two
            directions, which produces two distinct images. The power of double
            refraction is possessed by all crystals except those of the isometric
            system. A uniaxial crystal is said to be optically positive (like
            quartz), or optically negative (like calcite), or to have positive,
            or negative, double refraction, according as the optic axis is the
            axis of least or greatest elasticity for light; a biaxial crystal is
            similarly designated when the same relation holds for the acute
            bisectrix.

             — Refraction circle (Opt.), an instrument provided with a graduated
            circle for the measurement of refraction.
             — Refraction of latitude, longitude, declination, right ascension,
            etc., the change in the apparent latitude, longitude, etc., of a
            heavenly body, due to the effect of atmospheric refraction.
             — Terrestrial refraction, the change in the apparent altitude of a
            distant point on or near the earth's surface, as the top of a
            mountain, arising from the passage of light from it to the eye
            through atmospheric strata of varying density.</p>

             — Absolute refractive index (Opt.), the index of refraction of a

            is unnecessary, and irregular in formation. It is, however,
            sanctioned by the practice of many careful writers as a most
            convenient substitute for the phrase to be relied upon, and a useful
            synonym for trustworthy, which is by preference applied to persons,
            as reliable is to things, such as an account, statement, or the like.

            of a passive sense is met by the citation of laughable, worthy of

            able to be availed of, from the neuter verb to avail; dispensable,
            capable of being dispensed with, from the neuter verb to dispense.

            An orderly life so far as others are able to observe us is now and
            then produced by prudential motives or by dint of habit; but without
            seriousness there can be no religious principle at the bottom, no
            course of conduct from religious motives; in a word, there can be no
            religion. Paley.
            Religion [was] not, as too often now, used as equivalent for
            godliness; but . . . it expressed the outer form and embodiment which
            the inward spirit of a true or a false devotion assumed. Trench.
            Religions, by which are meant the modes of sdivine worship proper to
            different tribes, nations, or communities, and based on the belief
            held in common by the members of them severally . . . There is no
            living religion without something like a doctrine. On the other hand,
            a doctrine, however elaborate, does not constitute a religion. C. P.
            Tiele (Encyc. Brit. ).
            Religion . . . means the conscious relation between man and God, and
            the expression of that relation in human conduct. J. Köstlin (Schaff-

            After the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisce.

            Let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be
            maintained without religion. Washington.

            Those parts of pleading which in ancient times might perhaps be

            still continued with much religion. Sir M. Hale.</p>
            <p>Note: Religion, as distinguished from theology, is subjective,
            designating the feelings and acts of men which relate to God; while
            theology is objective, and denotes those ideas which man entertains
            respecting the God whom he worships, especially his systematized
            views of God. As distinguished from morality, religion denotes the
            influences and motives to human duty which are found in the character
            and will of God, while morality describes the duties to man, to which
            true religion always influences. As distinguished from piety,
            religion is a high sense of moral obligation and spirit of reverence
            or worship which affect the heart of man with respect to the Deity,
            while piety, which first expressed the feelings of a child toward a
            parent, is used for that filial sentiment of veneration and love
            which we owe to the Father of all. As distinguished from sanciti,
            religion is the means by which sanctity is achieved, sanctity
            denoting primarily that purity of heart and life which results from
            habitual communion with God, and a sense of his continual presence.
            Natural religion, a religion based upon the evidences of a God and

            <p>1. To mark in a notable manner; to distinquish clearly; to make

             — To observe; notice; heed; regard; note; say.
             — Remark, Observe, Notice. To observe is to keep or hold a thing
            distinctly before the mind. To remark is simply to mark or take note
            of whatever may come up. To notice implies still less continuity of
            attention. When we turn from these mental states to the expression of
            them in language, we find the same distinction. An observation is
            properly the result of somewhat prolonged thought; a remark is
            usually suggested by some passing occurence; a notice is in most
            cases something cursory and short. This distinction is not always
            maintained as to remark and observe, which are often used
            interchangeably. "Observing men may form many judgments by the rules
            of similitude and proportion." I. Watts. "He can not distinguish
            difficult and noble speculations from trifling and vulgar remarks."
            Collier. "The thing to be regarded, in taking notice of a child's
            miscarriage, is what root it springs from." Locke.</p>

            <p>1. To move away from the position occupied; to cause to change place;
            to displace; as, to remove a building.
            Thou shalt not remove thy neighbor's landmark. Deut. xix. 14.

            <p>REMOVE<br>
            Re*move" (r-mv"), v. i.
            </p>
            <p>Defn: To change place in any manner, or to make a change in place; to<br>
            move or go from one residence, position, or place to another.<br>

            Shak.
            </p>
            <p>Note: The verb remove, in some of its application, is synonymous with
            move, but not in all. Thus we do not apply remove to a mere change of
            posture, without a change of place or the seat of a thing. A man
            moves his head when he turns it, or his finger when he bends it, but
            he does not remove it. Remove usually or always denotes a change of
            place in a body, but we never apply it to a regular, continued course
            or motion. We never say the wind or water, or a ship, removes at a
            certain rate by the hour; but we say a ship was removed from one
            place in a harbor to another. Move is a generic term, including the
            sense of remove, which is more generally applied to a change from one
            station or permanent position, stand, or seat, to another station.</p>

            And drags at each remove a lengthening chain. Goldsmith.</p>
            <p>2. The transfer of one's business, or of one's domestic belongings,
            from one location or dwelling house to another; — in the United

            It is an English proverb that three removes are as bad as a fire. J.

            <p>Note: There are two distinct methods of reproduction; viz.: asexual
            reproduction (agamogenesis) and sexual reproduction (gamogenesis). In
            both cases the new individual is developed from detached portions of
            the parent organism. In asexual reproduction (gemmation, fission,
            etc.), the detached portions of the organism develop into new
            individuals without the intervention of other living matter. In
            sexual reproduction, the detached portion, which is always a single
            cell, called the female germ cell, is acted upon by another portion
            of living matter, the male germ cell, usually from another organism,
            and in the fusion of the two (impregnation) a new cell is formed,
            from the development of which arises a new individual.</p>

             — To reprehend; chide; rebuke; scold; blame censure.
             — Reprove, Rebuke, Reprimand. These words all signufy the
            expression of disapprobation. To reprove implies greater calmness and
            self-possession. To rebuke implies a more excited and personal
            feeling. A reproof may be administered long after the offience is
            committed, and is usually intended for the reformation of the
            offender; a rebuke is commonly given at the moment of the wrong, and
            is administered by way of punishment and condemnation. A reprimand
            proceeds from a person invested with authority, and is a formal and
            offiscial act. A child is reproved for his faults, and rebuked for
            his impudence. A military officer is reprimanded for neglect or
            violation of duty.</p>

             — Resentment, Anger. Anger is the broader term, denoting a keen
            sense of disapprobation (usually with a desire to punish) for watever
            we feel to be wrong, whether directed toward ourselves or others.
            Reseniment is anger exicted by a sense of personal injury. It is,
            etymologically, that reaction of the mind which we instinctively feel
            when we think ourselves wronged. Pride and selfishness are apt to
            aggravate this feeling until it changes into a criminal animosity;
            and this is now the more common signification of the term. Being
            founded in a sense of injury, this feeling is hard to be removed; and
            hence the expressions bitter or implacable resentment. See Anger.
            Anger is like A full-hot horse, who being allowed his way, Self-
            mettle tires him. Shak.

            which goes on with more vigor, in which the plant inhales and absorbs
            carbonic acid and exhales free oxygen.</p>

            fills us with awe; a union of wisdom and virtue in one who is
            advanced in years inspires us with veneration.</p>

             — Drive.
             — Ride, Drive. Ride originally meant (and is so used throughout the
            English Bible) to be carried on horseback or in a vehicle of any
            kind. At present in England, drive is the word applied in most cases
            to progress in a carriage; as, a drive around the park, etc.; while
            ride is appropriated to progress on a horse. Johnson seems to
            sanction this distinction by giving "to travel on horseback" as the
            leading sense of ride; though he adds "to travel in a vehicle" as a
            secondary sense. This latter use of the word still occurs to some
            extent; as, the queen rides to Parliament in her coach of state; to
            ride in an omnibus.

            <p>ROMAN CALENDAR<br>
            Roman calendar.
            </p>
            <p>Defn: The calendar of the ancient Romans, from which our modern
            calendars are derived. It is said to have consisted originally of ten
            months, Martius, Aprilis, Maius, Junius, Quintilis, Sextilis,
            September, October, November, and December, having a total of 304
            days. Numa added two months, Januarius at the beginning of the year,
            and Februarius at the end, making in all 355 days. He also ordered an
            intercalary month, Mercedinus, to be inserted every second year.
            Later the order of the months was changed so that January should come
            before February. Through abuse of power by the pontiffs to whose care
            it was committed, this calendar fell into confusion. It was replaced
            by the Julian calendar. In designating the days of the month, the
            Romans reckoned backward from three fixed points, the calends, the
            nones, and the ides. The calends were always the first day of the
            month. The ides fell on the 15th in March, May, July (Quintilis), and
            October, and on the 13th in other months. The nones came on the
            eighth day (the ninth, counting the ides) before the ides. Thus, Jan.
            13 was called the ides of January, Jan. 12, the day before the ides,
            and Jan. 11, the third day before the ides (since the ides count as
            one), while Jan. 14 was the 19th day before the calends of February.</p>
