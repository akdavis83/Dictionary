            <h2><a id="chap15"></a>O</h2>
            <p>1. O, the fifteenth letter of the English alphabet, derives its form,
            value, and name from the Greek O, through the Latin. The letter came
            into the Greek from the Phoenician, which possibly derived it
            ultimately from the Egyptian. Etymologically, the letter o is most
            closely related to a, e, and u; as in E. bone, AS. ban; E. stone, AS.
            stan; E. broke, AS. brecan to break; E. bore, AS. beran to bear; E.
            dove, AS. dufe; E. toft, tuft; tone, tune; number, F. nombre. The
            letter o has several vowel sounds, the principal of which are its
            long sound, as in bone, its short sound, as in nod, and the sounds
            heard in the words orb, son, do (feod), and wolf (book). In
            connection with the other vowels it forms several digraphs and
            diphthongs. See Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 107-129.</p>
            <p>2. Among the ancients, O was a mark of triple time, from the notion
            that the ternary, or number 3, is the most perfect of numbers, and
            properly expressed by a circle, the most perfect figure. O was also
            anciently used to represent 11: with a dash over it (O
            O, n.; pl. O's or Oes (.</p>

            descendant of, and is a character of dignity; as, O'Neil, O'Carrol.</p>

            <p>O<br>
            O, a. Etym: [See One.]

            <p>O<br>
            O, interj.
            </p>
            <p>Defn: An exclamation used in calling or directly addressing a person
            or personified object; also, as an emotional or impassioned
            exclamation expressing pain, grief, surprise, desire, fear, etc.
            For ever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven. Ps. cxix. 89.
            O how love I thy law ! it is my meditation all the day. Ps. cxix. 97.</p>
            <p>Note: O is frequently followed by an ellipsis and that, an in<br>
            expressing a wish: "O [I wish] that Ishmael might live before thee !"<br>
            Gen. xvii. 18; or in expressions of surprise, indignation, or regret:<br>
            "O [it is sad] that such eyes should e'er meet other object !"<br>
            Sheridan Knowles.
            </p>
            <p>Note: A distinction between the use of O and oh is insisted upon by
            some, namely, that O should be used only in direct address to a
            person or personified object, and should never be followed by the
            exclamation point, while Oh (or oh) should be used in exclamations
            where no direct appeal or address to an object is made, and may be
            followed by the exclamation point or not, according to the nature or
            construction of the sentence. Some insist that oh should be used only
            as an interjection expressing strong feeling. The form O, however,
            is, it seems, the one most commonly employed for both uses by modern
            writers and correctors for the press. "O, I am slain !" Shak. "O what
            a fair and ministering angel !" "O sweet angel !" Longfellow.
            O for a kindling touch from that pure flame ! Wordsworth.
            But she is in her grave, — and oh The difference to me ! Wordsworth.
            Oh for a lodge in some vast wilderness ! Cowper.
            We should distinguish between the sign of the vocative and the
            emotional interjection, writing O for the former, and oh for the
            latter. Earle.
            O dear, and O dear me! Etym: [corrupted fr. F. O Dieu! or It. O Dio!
            O God! O Dio mio! O my God! Wyman], exclamations expressive of
            various emotions, but usually promoted by surprise, consternation,
            grief, pain, etc.</p>

            <p>1. (Bot.)</p>
            <p>Defn: Any tree or shrub of the genus Quercus. The oaks have alternate
            leaves, often variously lobed, and staminate flowers in catkins. The
            fruit is a smooth nut, called an acorn, which is more or less
            inclosed in a scaly involucre called the cup or cupule. There are now
            recognized about three hundred species, of which nearly fifty occur
            in the United States, the rest in Europe, Asia, and the other parts
            of North America, a very few barely reaching the northern parts of
            South America and Africa. Many of the oaks form forest trees of grand
            proportions and live many centuries. The wood is usually hard and
            tough, and provided with conspicuous medullary rays, forming the
            silver grain.</p>

            <p>OBJECTIVE<br>
            Ob*jec"tive, a. Etym: [Cf.F. objectif.]
            </p>
            <p>1. Of or pertaining to an object.</p>
            <p>2. (Metaph.)</p>
            <p>Defn: Of or pertaining to an object; contained in, or having the
            nature or position of, an object; outward; external; extrinsic; — an
            epithet applied to whatever ir exterior to the mind, or which is
            simply an object of thought or feeling, and opposed to subjective.
            In the Middle Ages, subject meant substance, and has this sense in
            Descartes and Spinoza: sometimes, also, in Reid. Subjective is used
            by William of Occam to denote that which exists independent of mind;
            objective, what is formed by the mind. This shows what is meant by
            realitas objectiva in Descartes. Kant and Fichte have inverted the
            meanings. Subject, with them, is the mind which knows; object, that
            which is known; subjective, the varying conditions of the knowing
            mind; objective, that which is in the constant nature of the thing
            known. Trendelenburg.
            Objective means that which belongs to, or proceeds from, the object
            known, and not from the subject knowing, and thus denotes what is
            real, in opposition to that which is ideal — what exists in nature,
            in contrast to what exists merely in the thought of the individual.
            Sir. W. Hamilton.
            Objective has come to mean that which has independent exostence or
            authority, apart from our experience or thought. Thus, moral law is
            said to have objective authority, that is, authority belonging to
            itself, and not drawn from anything in our nature. Calderwood
            (Fleming's Vocabulary).</p>
            <p>3. (Gram.)</p>
            <p>Defn: Pertaining to, or designating, the case which follows a
            transitive verb or a preposition, being that case in which the direct
            object of the verb is placed. See Accusative, n.</p>
            <p>Note: The objective case is frequently used without a governing word,
            esp. in designations of time or space, where a preposition, as at,
            in, on, etc., may be supplied.
            My troublous dream [on] this night make me sad. Shak.
            To write of victories [in or for] next year. Hudibras.
            Objective line (Perspective), a line drawn on the geometrical plane
            which is represented or sought to be represented.
             — Objective plane (Perspective), any plane in the horizontal plane
            that is represented.
             — Objective point, the point or result to which the operations of
            an army are directed. By extension, the point or purpose to which
            anything, as a journey or an argument, is directed.</p>
            <p>Syn.
             — Objective, Subjective. Objective is applied to things exterior to
            the mind, and objects of its attention; subjective, to the operations
            of the mind itself. Hence, an objective motive is some outward thing
            awakening desire; a subjective motive is some internal feeling or
            propensity. Objective views are those governed by outward things;
            subjective views are produced or modified by internal feeling. Sir
            Walter Scott's poetry is chiefly objective; that of Wordsworth is
            eminently subjective.
            In the philosophy of mind, subjective denotes what is to be referred
            to the thinking subject, the ego; objective what belongs to the
            object of thought, the non-ego. Sir. W. Hamilton</p>

            <p>Syn.
             — Observance, Observation. These words are discriminated by the two
            distinct senses of observe. To observe means (1) to keep strictly;
            as, to observe a fast day, and hence, observance denotes the keeping
            or heeding with strictness; (2) to consider attentively, or to
            remark; and hence, observation denotes either the act of observing,
            or some remark made as the result thereof. We do not say the
            observation of Sunday, though the word was formerly so used. The
            Pharisees were curious in external observances; the astronomers are
            curious in celestial observations.

             — To attain; gain; procure; acquire; win; earn. See Attain.
             — To Obtain, Get, Gain, Earn, Acquire. The idea of getting is
            common to all these terms. We may, indeed, with only a slight change
            of sense, substitute get for either of them; as, to get or to gain a
            prize; to get or to obtain an employment; to get or to earn a living;
            to get or to acquire a language. To gain is to get by striving; and
            as this is often a part of our good fortune, the word gain is
            peculiarly applicable to whatever comes to us fortuitously. Thus, we
            gain a victory, we gain a cause, we gain an advantage, etc. To earn
            is to deserve by labor or service; as, to earn good wages; to earn a
            triumph. Unfortunately, one does not always get or obtain what he has
            earned. To obtain implies desire for possession, and some effort
            directed to the attainment of that which is not immediately within
            our reach. Whatever we thus seek and get, we obtain, whether by our
            own exertions or those of others; whether by good or bad means;
            whether permanently, or only for a time. Thus, a man obtains an
            employment; he obtains an answer to a letter, etc. To acquire is more
            limited and specific. We acquire what comes to us gradually in the
            regular exercise of our abilities, while we obtain what comes in any
            way, provided we desire it. Thus, we acquire knowledge, property,
            honor, reputation, etc. What we acquire becomes, to a great extent,
            permanently our own; as, to acquire a language; to acquire habits of
            industry, etc.</p>

            especially at 30-40° C. Chemically, olein is a glyceride of oleic
            acid; and, as three molecules of the acid are united to one molecule
            of glyceryl to form the fat, it is technically known as triolein. It

            meaning, out. See Deal, v. &amp; n., and cf. Arise, Ort.]</p>
            <p>1. An ancient form of test to determine guilt or innocence, by
            appealing to a supernatural decision, — once common in Europe, and
            still practiced in the East and by savage tribes.</p>
            <p>Note: In England ordeal by fire and ordeal by water were used, the
            former confined to persons of rank, the latter to the common people.
            The ordeal by fire was performed, either by handling red-hot iron, or
            by walking barefoot and blindfold over red-hot plowshares, laid at
            unequal distances. If the person escaped unhurt, he was adjudged
            innocent; otherwise he was condemned as guilty. The ordeal by water
            was performed, either by plunging the bare arm to the elbow in
            boiling water, an escape from injury being taken as proof of
            innocence, or by casting the accused person, bound hand and foot,
            into a river or pond, when if he floated it was an evidence of guilt,
            but if he sunk he was acquitted. It is probable that the proverbial
            phrase, to go through fire and water, denoting severe trial or
            danger, is derived from the ordeal. See Wager of battle, under Wager.</p>
            <p>2. Any severe trial, or test; a painful experience. Ordeal bean.
            (Bot.) See Calabar bean, under Calabar.

            pricked with a lance dipped in the juice of the seeds.</p>

            He saluted me on both cheeks in the orthodox manner. H. R. Haweis.</p>
            <p>Note: The term orthodox differs in its use among the various
            Christian communions. The Greek Church styles itself the "Holy
            Orthodox Apostolic Church," regarding all other bodies of Christians
            as more or less heterodox. The Roman Catholic Church regards the
            Protestant churches as heterodox in many points. In the United States
            the term orthodox is frequently used with reference to divergent
            views on the doctrine of the Trinity. Thus it has been common to
            speak of the Trinitarian Congregational churches in distinction from
            the Unitarian, as Orthodox. The name is also applied to the
            conservative, in distinction from the "liberal", or Hicksite, body in
            the Society of Friends. Schaff-Herzog Encyc.</p>

            when, in ignorance or forgetfulness of the true history and
            composition of the word, the orthography was change to make it
            represent the u of Gr. 'oxy`s, from which it was supposed to be

            <p>Note: In the chemical nomenclature adopted by Guyton de Morveau,
            Lavoisier,and their associates, the term oxides was made to include
            all compounds of oxygen which had no acid (F. acide) properties, as
            contrasted with the acid, all of which were at that time supposed to
            contain oxygen. The orthography oxyde, oxyd, etc., was afterwards
            introduced in ignorance or disregard of the true etymology, but these
            forms are now obsolete in English. The spelling oxid is not common.</p>

            (Chem.)
            </p>
            <p>Defn: To combine with oxygen, or subject to the action of oxygen, or
            of an oxidizing agent. Specifically:
            (a) To combine with oxygen or with more oxygen; to add oxygen to; as,
            to oxidize nitrous acid so as to form nitric acid.
            (b) To remove hydrogen from (anything), as by the action of oxygen;
            as, to oxidize alcohol so as to form aldehyde.

            compound; as, to oxidize mercurous chloride to mercuric chloride.</p>
            <p>Note: In certain cases to oxidize is identical with to acidify; for,
            in nearly all cases, the more oxygen a substance contains the more
            nearly does it approximate to acid qualities; thus, by oxidation many
            elements, as sulphur, nitrogen, carbon, chromium, manganese, etc.,
            pass into compounds which are acid anhydrides, and thus practically
            in the acid state.</p>

            </p>
            <p>1. (Chem.)</p>
            <p>Defn: A colorless, tasteless, odorless, gaseous element occurring in
            the free state in the atmosphere, of which it forms about 23 per cent
            by weight and about 21 per cent by volume, being slightly heavier
            than nitrogen. Symbol O. Atomic weight 15.96.</p>
            <p>Note: It occurs combined in immense quantities, forming eight ninths
            by weight of water, and probably one half by weight of the entire
            solid crust of the globe, being an ingredient of silica, the
            silicates, sulphates, carbonates, nitrates, etc. Oxygen combines with
            all elements (except fluorine), forming oxides, bases, oxyacid
            anhydrides, etc., the process in general being called oxidation, of
            which combustion is only an intense modification. At ordinary
            temperatures with most substances it is moderately active, but at
            higher temperatures it is one of the most violent and powerful
            chemical agents known. It is indispensable in respiration, and in
            general is the most universally active and efficient element. It may
            be prepared in the pure state by heating potassium chlorate. This
            element (called dephlogisticated air by Priestley) was named oxygen
            by Lavoisier because he supposed it to be a constituent of all acids.
            This is not so in the case of a very few acids (as hydrochloric,
            hydrobromic, hydric sulphide, etc.), but these do contain elements
            analogous to oxygen in property and action. Moreover, the fact that
            most elements approach the nearer to acid qualities in proportion as
            they are combined with more oxygen, shows the great accuracy and
            breadth of Lavoisier's conception of its nature.</p>
