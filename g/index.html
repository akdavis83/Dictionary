            <h2><a id="chap07"></a>G</h2>
            <p>1. G is the seventh letter of the English alphabet, and a vocal
            consonant. It has two sounds; one simple, as in gave, go, gull; the
            other compound (like that of j), as in gem, gin, dingy. See Guide to
            Pronunciation, §§ 231-6, 155, 176, 178, 179, 196, 211, 246.</p>
            <p>Note: The form of G is from the Latin, in the alphabet which it first
            appeared as a modified form of C. The name is also from the Latin,
            and probably comes to us through the French. Etymologically it is
            most closely related to a c hard, k y, and w; as in corn, grain,
            kernel; kin L. genus, Gr. garden, yard; drag, draw; also to ch and h;
            as in get, prehensile; guest, host (an army); gall, choler; gust,
            choose. See C.</p>
            <p>2. (Mus.)</p>
            <p>Defn: G is the name of the fifth tone of the natural or model scale;
            — called also sol by the Italians and French. It was also originally
            used as the treble clef, and has gradually changed into the character
            represented in the margin. See Clef. G# (G sharp) is a tone
            intermediate between G and A.</p>

            <p>1. An aëriform fluid; — a term used at first by chemists as
            synonymous with air, but since restricted to fluids supposed to be
            permanently elastic, as oxygen, hydrogen, etc., in distinction from
            vapors, as steam, which become liquid on a reduction of temperature.
            In present usage, since all of the supposed permanent gases have been
            liquified by cold and pressure, the term has resumed nearly its
            original signification, and is applied to any substance in the

            <p>Defn: The formation or production of any geometrical magnitude, as a
            line, a surface, a solid, by the motion, in accordance with a

            line or curve by the motion of a point, of a surface by a line, a

            <p>7. (Biol.)</p>
            <p>Defn: The aggregate of the functions and phenomene which attend
            reproduction.</p>
            <p>Note: There are four modes of generation in the animal kingdom:
            scissiparity or by fissiparous generation, gemmiparity or by budding,
            germiparity or by germs, and oviparity or by ova. Alternate
            generation (Biol.), alternation of sexual with asexual generation, in
            which the products of one process differ from those of the other, —
            a form of reproduction common both to animal and vegetable organisms.
            In the simplest form, the organism arising from sexual generation
            produces offspiring unlike itself, agamogenetically. These, however,
            in time acquire reproductive organs, and from their impregnated germs
            the original parent form is reproduced. In more complicated cases,
            the first series of organisms produced agamogenetically may give rise
            to others by a like process, and these in turn to still other
            generations. Ultimately, however, a generation is formed which
            develops sexual organs, and the original form is reproduced.
             — Spontaneous generation (Biol.), the fancied production of living
            organisms without previously existing parents from inorganic matter,
            or from decomposing organic matter, a notion which at one time had
            many supporters; abiogenesis.</p>

             — Genius, Talent. Genius implies high and peculiar gifts of nature,
            impelling the mind to certain favorite kinds of mental effort, and
            producing new combinations of ideas, imagery, etc. Talent supposes
            general strength of intellect, with a peculiar aptitude for being
            molded and directed to specific employments and valuable ends and
            purposes. Genius is connected more or less with the exercise of
            imagination, and reaches its ends by a kind of intuitive power.
            Talent depends more on high mental training, and a perfect command of
            all the faculties, memory, judgment, sagacity, etc. Hence we speak of
            a genius for poetry, painting. etc., and a talent for business or

            they may receive a common substantive name. A genus is not
            necessarily the lowest definable group of species, for it may often
            be divided into several subgenera. In proportion as its definition is
            exact, it is natural genus; if its definition can not be made clear,
            it is more or less an artificial genus.</p>

            panther are species of the Cat kind or genus, while in the vegetable
            kingdom all the species of oak form a single genus. Some genera are
            represented by a multitude of species, as Solanum (Nightshade) and
            Carex (Sedge), others by few, and some by only one known species.

            <p>Note: Geometrical is often used in a limited or strictly technical
            sense, as opposed to mechanical; thus, a construction or solution is
            geometrical which can be made by ruler and compasses, i. e., by means
            of right lines and circles. Every construction or solution which
            requires any other curve, or such motion of a line or circle as would
            generate any other curve, is not geometrical, but mechanical. By
            another distinction, a geometrical solution is one obtained by the
            rules of geometry, or processes of analysis, and hence is exact;
            while a mechanical solution is one obtained by trial, by actual
            measurements, with instruments, etc., and is only approximate and
            empirical. Geometrical curve. Same as Algebraic curve; — so called

            or spores of which are either contained in the organism itself, or
            transferred through the air or water. See Fermentation theory.</p>

             — Glad, Delighted, Gratified. Delighted expresses a much higher
            degree of pleasure than glad. Gratified always refers to a pleasure
            conferred by some human agent, and the feeling is modified by the
            consideration that we owe it in part to another. A person may be glad
            or delighted to see a friend, and gratified at the attention shown by
            his visits.</p>

            Sw. &amp; Dan. guld, Goth. gulp, Russ. &amp; OSlav. zlato; prob. akin to E.<br>
            yellow. Yellow, and cf. Gild, v. t.]
            </p>
            <p>1. (Chem.)</p>
            <p>Defn: A metallic element, constituting the most precious metal used
            as a common commercial medium of exchange. It has a characteristic
            yellow color, is one of the heaviest substances known (specific
            gravity 19.32), is soft, and very malleable and ductile. It is quite
            unalterable by heat, moisture, and most corrosive agents, and
            therefore well suited for its use in coin and jewelry. Symbol Au
            (Aurum). Atomic weight 196.7.</p>
            <p>Note: Native gold contains usually eight to ten per cent of silver,
            but often much more. As the amount of silver increases, the color
            becomes whiter and the specific gravity lower. Gold is very widely
            disseminated, as in the sands of many rivers, but in very small
            quantity. It usually occurs in quartz veins (gold quartz), in slate
            and metamorphic rocks, or in sand and alluvial soil, resulting from
            the disintegration of such rocks. It also occurs associated with
            other metallic substances, as in auriferous pyrites, and is combined
            with tellurium in the minerals petzite, calaverite, sylvanite, etc.
            Pure gold is too soft for ordinary use, and is hardened by alloying
            with silver and copper, the latter giving a characteristic reddish
            tinge. [See Carat.] Gold also finds use in gold foil, in the pigment
            purple of Cassius, and in the chloride, which is used as a toning
            agent in photography.</p>

            ease and cheerfulness, as displayed in one's outward deportment and
            in social intercourse. A good-natured man recommends himself to all

            himself particularly as a companion. A good-tempered man is rarely

            circle.</p>

             — Affiction; sorrow; distress; sadness; trial; grievance. Grief,
            Sorrow, Sadness. Sorrow is the generic term; grief is sorrow for some
            definite cause — one which commenced, at least, in the past; sadness
            is applied to a permanent mood of the mind. Sorrow is transient in
            many cases; but the grief of a mother for the loss of a favorite
            child too often turns into habitual sadness. "Grief is sometimes
            considered as synonymous with sorrow; and in this case we speak of
            the transports of grief. At other times it expresses more silent,
            deep, and painful affections, such as are inspired by domestic
            calamities, particularly by the loss of friends and relatives, or by
            the distress, either of body or mind, experienced by those whom we
            love and value." Cogan.See Affliction.</p>

            nitric acid radicals, yet the results exactly resemble ordinary
            cotton in appearance. It burns without ash, with explosion if
            confined, but quietly and harmlessly if free and open, and in small
            quantity. Specifically, the lower nitrates of cellulose which are
            insoluble in ether and alcohol in distinction from the highest
            (pyroxylin) which is soluble. See Pyroxylin, and cf. Xyloidin. The
            gun cottons are used for blasting and somewhat in gunnery: for making
            celluloid when compounded with camphor; and the soluble variety
            (pyroxylin) for making collodion. See Celluloid, and Collodion. Gun
            cotton is frequenty but improperly called nitrocellulose. It is not a
