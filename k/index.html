            <h2><a id="chap11"></a>K</h2>
            <p>Defn: (K is from the Latin, which used the letter but little except
            in the early period of the language. It came into the Latin from the
            Greek, which received it from a Phoenician source, the ultimate
            origin probably being Egyptian,. Etymologically K is most nearly
            related to c, g, h (which see).</p>
            <p>Note: In many words of one syllable k is used after c, as in crack,
            check, deck, being necessary to exhibit a correct pronunciation in
            the derivatives, cracked, checked, decked, cracking; since without
            it, c, before the vowels e and i, would be sounded like s. Formerly,
            k was added to c in certain words of Latin origin, as in musick,
            publick, republick; but now it is omitted.</p>
