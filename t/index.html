            Tall, a. [Compar. Taller; superl. Tallest.] Etym: [OE. tal seemly,

            Goth. untals indocile, disobedient, uninstructed, or W. &amp; Corn. tal
            high, Ir. talla meet, fit, proper, just.]</p>
            <p>1. High in stature; having a considerable, or an unusual, extension
            upward; long and comparatively slender; having the diameter or
            lateral extent small in proportion to the height; as, a tall person,

            <p>Syn.
             — High; lofty.
             — Tall, High, Lofty. High is the generic term, and is applied to
            anything which is elevated or raised above another thing. Tall
            specifically describes that which has a small diameter in proportion
            to its height; hence, we speak of a tall man, a tall steeple, a tall
            mast, etc., but not of a tall hill. Lofty has a special reference to
            the expanse above us, and denotes an imposing height; as, a lofty
            mountain; a lofty room. Tall is now properly applied only to physical
            objects; high and lofty have a moral acceptation; as, high thought,
            purpose, etc.; lofty aspirations; a lofty genius. Lofty is the
            stronger word, and is usually coupled with the grand or admirable.</p>

            <p>TALLY
            Tal"ly, n.; pl. Tallies. Etym: [OE. taile, taille, F. taille a
            cutting, cut tally, fr. tailler to cut, but influenced probably by
            taillé, p.p. of tailler. See Tailor, and cf. Tail a limitation,
            Taille, Tallage.]</p>
            <p>1. Originally, a piece of wood on which notches or scores were cut,
            as the marks of number; later, one of two books, sheets of paper,
            etc., on which corresponding accounts were kept.</p>
            <p>Note: In purshasing and selling, it was once customary for traders to
            have two sticks, or one stick cleft into two parts, and to mark with
            a score or notch, on each, the number or quantity of goods delivered,
            — the seller keeping one stick, and the purchaser the other. Before
            the use of writing, this, or something like it, was the only method
            of keeping accounts; and tallies were received as evidence in courts
            of justice. In the English exchequer were tallies of loans, one part
            being kept in the exchequer, the other being given to the creditor in
            lieu of an obligation for money lent to government.</p>
            <p>2. Hence, any account or score kept by notches or marks, whether on
            wood or paper, or in a book; especially, one kept in duplicate.</p>
            <p>3. One thing made to suit another; a match; a mate.
            They were framed the tallies for each other. Dryden.</p>
            <p>4. A notch, mark, or score made on or in a tally; as, to make or earn
            a tally in a game.</p>
            <p>5. A tally shop. See Tally shop, below. Tally shop, a shop at which
            goods or articles are sold to customers on account, the account being
            kept in corresponding books, one called the tally, kept by the buyer,
            the other the counter tally, kept by the seller, and the payments
            being made weekly or otherwise by agreement. The trade thus regulated
            is called tally trade. Eng. Encyc.

            <p>TASTE<br>

            <p>3. (Physiol.)</p>
            <p>Defn: The one of the five senses by which certain properties of
            bodies (called their taste, savor, flavor) are ascertained by contact
            with the organs of taste.</p>
            <p>Note: Taste depends mainly on the contact of soluble matter with the
            terminal organs (connected with branches of the glossopharyngeal and
            other nerves) in the papillæ on the surface of the tongue. The base

            <p>Syn.
             — Savor; relish; flavor; sensibility; gout.
             — Taste, Sensibility, Judgment. Some consider taste as a mere
            sensibility, and others as a simple exercise of judgment; but a union
            of both is requisite to the existence of anything which deserves the
            name. An original sense of the beautiful is just as necessary to
            æsthetic judgments, as a sense of right and wrong to the formation of
            any just conclusions or moral subjects. But this "sense of the
            beautiful" is not an arbitrary principle. It is under the guidance of
            reason; it grows in delicacy and correctness with the progress of the
            individual and of society at large; it has its laws, which are seated
            in the nature of man; and it is in the development of these laws that
            we find the true "standard of taste."
            What, then, is taste, but those internal powers, Active and strong,
            and feelingly alive To each fine impulse a discerning sense Of decent
            and sublime, with quick disgust From things deformed, or disarranged,
            or gross In species This, nor gems, nor stores of gold, Nor purple
            state, nor culture, can bestow, But God alone, when first his active
            hand Imprints the secret bias of the soul. Akenside.
            Taste of buds, or Taste of goblets (Anat.), the flask-shaped end
            organs of taste in the epithelium of the tongue. They are made up of

            <p>TEA<br>
            Tea, n. Etym: [Chin. tsha, Prov. Chin. te: cf. F. thé.]
            </p>
            <p>1. The prepared leaves of a shrub, or small tree (Thea, or Camellia,
            Chinensis). The shrub is a native of China, but has been introduced
            to some extent into some other countries.</p>
            <p>Note: Teas are classed as green or black, according to their color or
            appearance, the kinds being distinguished also by various other
            characteristic differences, as of taste, odor, and the like. The
            color, flavor, and quality are dependent upon the treatment which the
            leaves receive after being gathered. The leaves for green tea are
            heated, or roasted slightly, in shallow pans over a wood fire, almost
            immediately after being gathered, after which they are rolled with
            the hands upon a table, to free them from a portion of their
            moisture, and to twist them, and are then quickly dried. Those
            intended for black tea are spread out in the air for some time after
            being gathered, and then tossed about with the hands until they
            become soft and flaccid, when they are roasted for a few minutes, and
            rolled, and having then been exposed to the air for a few hours in a
            soft and moist state, are finally dried slowly over a charcoal fire.
            The operation of roasting and rolling is sometimes repeated several
            times, until the leaves have become of the proper color. The
            principal sorts of green tea are Twankay, the poorest kind; Hyson
            skin, the refuse of Hyson; Hyson, Imperial, and Gunpowder, fine
            varieties; and Young Hyson, a choice kind made from young leaves
            gathered early in the spring. Those of black tea are Bohea, the
            poorest kind; Congou; Oolong; Souchong, one of the finest varieties;
            and Pekoe, a fine-flavored kind, made chiefly from young spring buds.
            See Bohea, Congou, Gunpowder tea, under Gunpowder, Hyson, Oolong, and
            Souchong. K. Johnson. Tomlinson.</p>
            <p>Note: "No knowledge of . . . [tea] appears to have reached Europe
            till after the establishment of intercourse between Portugal and
            China in 1517. The Portuguese, however, did little towards the
            introduction of the herb into Europe, and it was not till the Dutch
            established themselves at Bantam early in 17th century, that these
            adventurers learned from the Chinese the habit of tea drinking, and
            brought it to Europe." Encyc. Brit.</p>

             — To vex; harass: annoy; disturb; irritate; plague; torment;
            mortify; tantalize; chagrin.
             — Tease, Vex. To tease is literally to pull or scratch, and implies
            a prolonged annoyance in respect to little things, which is often
            more irritating, and harder to bear, than severe pain. Vex meant
            originally to seize and bear away hither and thither, and hence, to
            disturb; as, to vex the ocean with storms. This sense of the term now
            rarely occurs; but vex is still a stronger word than tease, denoting
            the disturbance or anger created by minor provocations, losses,
            disappointments, etc. We are teased by the buzzing of a fly in our
            eyes; we are vexed by the carelessness or stupidity of our servants.
            Not by the force of carnal reason, But indefatigable teasing.
            Hudibras.
            In disappointments, where the affections have been strongly placed,
            and the expectations sanguine, particularly where the agency of
            others is concerned, sorrow may degenerate into vexation and chagrin.

            </p>
            <p>Defn: An apparatus, or a process, for communicating intelligence
            rapidly between distant points, especially by means of preconcerted
            visible or audible signals representing words or ideas, or by means
            of words and signs, transmitted by electrical action.</p>
            <p>Note: The instruments used are classed as indicator, type-printing,
            symbol-printing, or chemical-printing telegraphs, according as the
            intelligence is given by the movements of a pointer or indicator, as
            in Cooke &amp; Wheatstone's (the form commonly used in England), or by
            impressing, on a fillet of paper, letters from types, as in House's
            and Hughe's, or dots and marks from a sharp point moved by a magnet,
            as in Morse's, or symbols produced by electro-chemical action, as in
            Bain's. In the offices in the United States the recording instrument
            is now little used, the receiving operator reading by ear the
            combinations of long and short intervals of sound produced by the
            armature of an electro-magnet as it is put in motion by the opening
            and breaking of the circuit, which motion, in registering
            instruments, traces upon a ribbon of paper the lines and dots used to
            represent the letters of the alphabet. See Illustration in Appendix.
            Acoustic telegraph. See under Acoustic.
             — Dial telegraph, a telegraph in which letters of the alphabet and
            numbers or other symbols are placed upon the border of a circular
            dial plate at each station, the apparatus being so arranged that the
            needle or index of the dial at the receiving station accurately
            copies the movements of that at the sending station.
             — Electric telegraph, or Electro-magnetic telegraph, a telegraph in
            which an operator at one station causes words or signs to be made at
            another by means of a current of electricity, generated by a battery
            and transmitted over an intervening wire.
             — Facsimile telegraph. See under Facsimile.
             — Indicator telegraph. See under Indicator.
             — Pan-telegraph, an electric telegraph by means of which a drawing
            or writing, as an autographic message, may be exactly reproduced at a
            distant station.
             — Printing telegraph, an electric telegraph which automatically
            prints the message as it is received at a distant station, in
            letters, not signs.
             — Signal telegraph, a telegraph in which preconcerted signals, made
            by a machine, or otherwise, at one station, are seen or heard and
            interpreted at another; a semaphore.
             — Submarine telegraph cable, a telegraph cable laid under water to
            connect stations separated by a body of water.
             — Telegraph cable, a telegraphic cable consisting of several
            conducting wires, inclosed by an insulating and protecting material,
            so as to bring the wires into compact compass for use on poles, or to
            form a strong cable impervious to water, to be laid under ground, as
            in a town or city, or under water, as in the ocean.
             — Telegraph plant (Bot.), a leguminous plant (Desmodium gyrans)

            Tel"e*phone, n. Etym: [Gr. (Physics)
            </p>
            <p>Defn: An instrument for reproducing sounds, especially articulate
            speech, at a distance.</p>
            <p>Note: The ordinary telephone consists essentially of a device by
            which currents of electricity, produced by sounds through the agency
            of certain mechanical devices and exactly corresponding in duration
            and intensity to the vibrations of the air which attend them, are
            transmitted to a distant station, and there, acting on suitable
            mechanism, reproduce similar sounds by repeating the vibrations. The
            necessary variations in the electrical currents are usually produced
            by means of a microphone attached to a thin diaphragm upon which the
            voice acts, and are intensified by means of an induction coil. In the
            magnetic telephone, or magneto-telephone, the diaphragm is of soft
            iron placed close to the pole of a magnet upon which is wound a coil
            of fine wire, and its vibrations produce corresponding vibrable
            currents in the wire by induction. The mechanical, or string,
            telephone is a device in which the voice or sound causes vibrations
            in a thin diaphragm, which are directly transmitted along a wire or
            string connecting it to a similar diaphragm at the remote station,
            thus reproducing the sound. It does not employ electricity.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Defn: An optical instrument used in viewing distant objects, as the
            heavenly bodies.</p>
            <p>Note: A telescope assists the eye chiefly in two ways; first, by
            enlarging the visual angle under which a distant object is seen, and
            thus magnifying that object; and, secondly, by collecting, and
            conveying to the eye, a larger beam of light than would enter the
            naked organ, thus rendering objects distinct and visible which would
            otherwise be indistinct and or invisible. Its essential parts are the
            object glass, or concave mirror, which collects the beam of light,
            and forms an image of the object, and the eyeglass, which is a
            microscope, by which the image is magnified. Achromatic telescope.
            See under Achromatic.

            secondary speculum convex instead of concave, and placed nearer the
            large speculum. The Cassegrainian represents objects inverted; the
            Gregorian, in their natural position. The Melbourne telescope (see

            This was the construction originally adopted by Galileo, the inventor
            of the instrument. It exhibits the objects erect, that is, in their
            natural positions.

            employed, by means of which an image of the object is formed near one
            side of the open end of the tube, and to this the eyeglass is applied
            directly.
             — Newtonian telescope, a form of reflecting telescope. See under
            Newtonian.

             — Prism telescope. See Teinoscope.
             — Reflecting telescope, a telescope in which the image is formed by
            a speculum or mirror (or usually by two speculums, a large one at the
            lower end of the telescope, and the smaller one near the open end)
            instead of an object glass. See Gregorian, Cassegrainian,
            Herschelian, and Newtonian, telescopes, above.

             — Rashness; precipitancy; heedlessness; venturesomeness.
             — Temerity, Rashness. These words are closely allied in sense, but
            have a slight difference in their use and application. Temerity is
            Latin, and rashness is Anglo-Saxon. As in many such cases, the Latin
            term is more select and dignified; the Anglo-Saxon more familiar and
            energetic. We show temerity in hasty decisions, and the conduct to
            which they lead. We show rashness in particular actions, as dictated
            by sudden impulse. It is an exhibition of temerity to approach the
            verge of a precipice; it is an act of rashness to jump into a river
            without being able to swim. Temerity, then, is an unreasonable
            contempt of danger; rashness is a rushing into danger from
            thoughtlessness or excited feeling.
            It is notorious temerity to pass sentence upon grounds uncapable of
            evidence. Barrow.

            Jerusalem, in the early part of the 12th century, for the protection
            of pilgrims and of the Holy Sepulcher. These Knights Templars, or
            Knights of the Temple, were so named because they occupied an
            apartment of the palace of Bladwin II. in Jerusalem, near the Temple.</p>
            <p>Note: The order was first limited in numbers, and its members were
            bound by vows of chastity and poverty. After the conquest of
            Palestine by the Saracens, the Templars spread over Europe, and, by
            reason of their reputation for valor and piety, they were enriched by
            numerous donations of money and lands. The extravagances and vices of
            the later Templars, however, finally led to the suppression of the
            order by the Council of Vienne in 1312.</p>

            Tenable.]
            </p>
            <p>1. The act or right of holding, as property, especially real estate.
            That the tenure of estates might rest on equity, the Indian title to
            lands was in all cases to be quieted. Bancroft.</p>

            <p>Defn: The manner of holding lands and tenements of a superior.</p>
            <p>Note: Tenure is inseparable from the idea of property in land,
            according to the theory of the English law; and this idea of tenure
            pervades, to a considerable extent, the law of real property in the
            United States, where the title to land is essentially allodial, and
            almost all lands are held in fee simple, not of a superior, but the
            whole right and title to the property being vested in the owner.
            Tenure, in general, then, is the particular manner of holding real
            estate, as by exclusive title or ownership, by fee simple, by fee
            tail, by courtesy, in dower, by copyhold, by lease, at will, etc.</p>

            land gives to his lord or superior for the use of his land.</p>
            <p>4. Manner of holding, in general; as, in absolute governments, men
            hold their rights by a precarious tenure.
            All that seems thine own, Held by the tenure of his will alone.

            </p>
            <p>1. That which limits the extent of anything; limit; extremity; bound;
            boundary.

            (c) The time in which a court is held or is open for the trial of

            <p>Note: In England, there were formerly four terms in the year, during
            which the superior courts were open: Hilary term, beginning on the
            11th and ending on the 31st of January; Easter term, beginning on the
            15th of April, and ending on the 8th of May; Trinity term, beginning
            on the 22d day of May, and ending on the 12th of June; Michaelmas
            term, beginning on the 2d and ending on the 25th day of November. The
            rest of the year was called vacation. But this division has been
            practically abolished by the Judicature Acts of 1873, 1875, which
            provide for the more convenient arrangement of the terms and
            vacations. In the United States, the terms to be observed by the
            tribunals of justice are prescribed by the statutes of Congress and
            of the several States.</p>
            <p>6. (Logic)</p>
            <p>Defn: The subject or the predicate of a proposition; one of the three
            component parts of a syllogism, each one of which is used twice.
            The subject and predicate of a proposition are, after Aristotle,
            together called its terms or extremes. Sir W. Hamilton.</p>
            <p>Note: The predicate of the conclusion is called the major term,
            because it is the most general, and the subject of the conclusion is
            called the minor term, because it is less general. These are called
            the extermes; and the third term, introduced as a common measure
            between them, is called the mean or middle term. Thus in the
            following syllogism, —Every vegetable is combustible; Every tree is
            a vegetable; Therefore every tree is combustible, -combustible, the
            predicate of the conclusion, is the major term; tree is the minor
            term; vegetable is the middle term.</p>
            <p>7. A word or expression; specifically, one that has a precisely
            limited meaning in certain relations and uses, or is peculiar to a
            science, art, profession, or the like; as, a technical term. "Terms
            quaint of law." Chaucer.
            In painting, the greatest beauties can not always be expressed for
            want of terms. Dryden.</p>

            <p>Note: The pillar part frequently tapers downward, or is narrowest at
            the base. Terms rudely carved were formerly used for landmarks or
            boundaries. Gwilt.</p>

            to or accepted by another, settle the contract and bind the parties;

            <p>Defn: In Scotland, the time fixed for the payment of rents.</p>
            <p>Note: Terms legal and conventional in Scotland correspond to quarter<br>
            days in England and Ireland. There are two legal terms — Whitsunday,<br>
            May 15, and Martinmas, Nov. 11; and two conventional terms —<br>
            Candlemas, Feb. 2, and Lammas day, Aug. 1. Mozley &amp; W.

            <p>13. (Naut.)</p>

            J. Knowels. In term, in set terms; in formal phrase. [Obs.]<br>
            I can not speak in term. Chaucer.<br>
            — Term fee (Law) (a), a fee by the term, chargeable to a suitor, or<br>
            by law fixed and taxable in the costs of a cause for each or any term<br>
            it is in court.<br>
             — Terms of a proportion (Math.), the four members of which it is<br>
            composed.<br>
             — To bring to terms, to compel (one) to agree, assent, or submit;<br>
            to force (one) to come to terms.<br>
             — To make terms, to come to terms; to make an agreement: to agree.
            </p>
            <p>Syn.
             — Limit; bound; boundary; condition; stipulation; word; expression.
             — Term, Word. These are more frequently interchanged than almost
            any other vocables that occur of the language. There is, however, a
            difference between them which is worthy of being kept in mind. Word
            is generic; it denotes an utterance which represents or expresses our
            thoughts and feelings. Term originally denoted one of the two
            essential members of a proposition in logic, and hence signifies a
            word of specific meaning, and applicable to a definite class of
            objects. Thus, we may speak of a scientific or a technical term, and
            of stating things in distinct terms. Thus we say, "the term minister
            literally denotes servant;" "an exact definition of terms is
            essential to clearness of thought;" "no term of reproach can
            sufficiently express my indignation;" "every art has its peculiar and
            distinctive terms," etc. So also we say, "purity of style depends on
            the choice of words, and precision of style on a clear understanding
            of the terms used." Term is chiefly applied to verbs, nouns, and
            adjectives, these being capable of standing as terms in a logical
            proposition; while prepositions and conjunctions, which can never be
            so employed, are rarely spoken of as terms, but simply as words.</p>

            innocent passage by the vessels of other states.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it may be said without impropriety that a state has
            theoretically the right to extend its territorial waters from time to
            time at its will with the increased range of guns. Whether it would
            in practice be judicious to do so . . . is a widely different matter
            . . . . In any case the custom of regulating a line three miles from
            land as defining the boundary of marginal territorial waters is so
            far fixed that a state must be supposed to accept it in absence of
            express notice.

             — Neat; concise; compact. Terse, Concise. Terse was defined by
            Johnson "cleanly written", i. e., free from blemishes, neat or
            smooth. Its present sense is "free from excrescences," and hence,

            lones of Whitehead: -
            "In eight terse lines has Phædrus told (So frugal were the bards of
            old) A tale of goats; and closed with grace, Plan, moral, all, in
            that short space." It differs from concise in not implying, perhaps,
            quite as much condensation, but chiefly in the additional idea of
            "grace or elegance." — Terse"ly, adv.

             — Test, Trial. Trial is the wider term; test is a searching and

            metals are melted for trial and refinement. Hence the peculiar force

            kind.

             — Proof; evidence; attestation; witness; affirmation; confirmation;
            averment.
             — Testimony, Proof, Evidence. Proof is the most familiar, and is
            used more frequently (though not exclusively) of facts and things
            which occur in the ordinary concerns of life. Evidence is a word of
            more dignity, and is more generally applied to that which is moral or
            intellectual; as, the evidences of Christianity, etc. Testimony is
            what is deposed to by a witness on oath or affirmation. When used
            figuratively or in a wider sense, the word testimony has still a
            reference to some living agent as its author, as when we speak of the
            testimony of conscience, or of doing a thing in testimony of our
            affection, etc. Testimony refers rather to the thing declared,
            evidence to its value or effect. "To conform our language more to
            common use, we ought to divide arguments into demonstrations, proofs,
            and probabilities; ba proofs, meaning such arguments from experience
            as leave no room for doubt or opposition." Hume. "The evidence of
            sense is the first and highest kind of evidence of which human nature
            is capable." Bp. Wilkins. "The proof of everything must be by the
            testimony of such as the parties produce." Spenser.</p>

            <p>Defn: A phylum of plants of very diverse habit and structure,
            including the algæ, fungi, and lichens. The simpler forms, as many
            blue-green algæ, yeasts, etc., are unicellular and reproduce
            vegetatively or  by means of asexual spores; in the higher forms the
            plant body is a thallus, which may be filamentous or may consist of
            plates of cells; it is commonly undifferentiated into stem, leaves,
            and roots, and shows no distinct tissue systems; the fronds of many
            algæ, however, are modified to serve many of the functions of the
            above-named organs. Both asexual and sexual reproduction, often of a
            complex type, occur in these forms. The Thallophyta exist almost
            exclusively as gametophytes, the sporophyte being absent or
            rudimentary. By those who do not separate the Myxophyta from the
            Tallophyta as a distinct phylum the latter is treated as the
            lowermost group in the vegetable kingdom.</p>

            sing. of the article (originally a demonstrative pronoun). The nom.
            masc. se, and the nom. fem. seó are from a different root. AS.
            th\'91t is akin to D. dat, G. das, OHG. daz, Sw. &amp; Dan. det, Icel.
            Þat (masc. sa, fem. so), Goth. Þata (masc. sa, fem. so), Gr. tat (for
            tad, masc. sas, fem. sa); cf. L. istud that. *184. Cf. The, Their,
            They, Them, This, Than, Since.]</p>
            <p>1. As a demonstrative pronoun (pl. Those), that usually points out,
            or refers to, a person or thing previously mentioned, or supposed to
            be understood. That, as a demonstrative, may precede the noun to
            which it refers; as, that which he has said is true; those in the
            basket are good apples.
            The early fame of Gratian was equal to that of the most celebrated
            princes. Gibbon.</p>
            <p>Note: That may refer to an entire sentence or paragraph, and not
            merely to a word. It usually follows, but sometimes precedes, the
            sentence referred to.
            That be far from thee, to do after this manner, to slay the righteous
            with the wicked. Gen. xviii. 25.
            And when Moses heard that, he was content. Lev. x. 20.
            I will know your business, Harry, that I will. Shak.</p>
            <p>Note: That is often used in opposition to this, or by way of
            distinction, and in such cases this, like the Latin hic and French
            ceci, generally refers to that which is nearer, and that, like Latin
            ille and French cela, to that which is more remote. When they refer
            to foreign words or phrases, this generally refers to the latter, and
            that to the former.
            Two principles in human nature reign; Self-love, to urge, and Reason,
            to restrain; Nor this a good, nor that a bad we call. Pope.
            If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this or that. James iv. 16.</p>
            <p>2. As an adjective, that has the same demonstrative force as the
            pronoun, but is followed by a noun.
            It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of
            judgment, than for that city. Matt. x. 15.
            The woman was made whole from that hour. Matt. ix. 22.</p>
            <p>Note: That was formerly sometimes used with the force of the article
            the, especially in the phrases that one, that other, which were
            subsequently corrupted into th'tone, th'tother (now written t'other).
            Upon a day out riden knightes two . . . That one of them came home,
            that other not. Chaucer.</p>
            <p>3. As a relative pronoun, that is equivalent to who or which, serving
            to point out, and make definite, a person or thing spoken of, or
            alluded to, before, and may be either singular or plural.
            He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame. Prov. ix. 7.
            A judgment that is equal and impartial must incline to the greater
            probabilities. Bp. Wilkins.</p>
            <p>Note: If the relative clause simply conveys an additional idea, and
            is not properly explanatory or restrictive, who or which (rarely
            that) is employed; as, the king that (or who) rules well is generally
            popular; Victoria, who (not that) rules well, enjoys the confidence
            of her subjects. Ambiguity may in some cases be avoided in the use of
            that (which is restrictive) instead of who or which, likely to be
            understood in a coördinating sense. Bain. That was formerly used for
            that which, as what is now; but such use is now archaic.
            We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen. John iii.
            11.
            That I have done it is thyself to wite [blame]. Chaucer.
            That, as a relative pronoun, cannot be governed by a preposition
            preceding it, but may be governed by one at the end of the sentence
            which it commences.
            The ship that somebody was sailing in. Sir W. Scott.
            In Old English, that was often used with the demonstratives he, his,
            him, etc., and the two together had the force of a relative pronoun;
            thus, that he = who; that his = whose; that him = whom.
            I saw to-day a corpse yborn to church That now on Monday last I saw
            him wirche [work]. Chaucer.
            Formerly, that was used, where we now commonly use which, as a
            relative pronoun with the demonstrative pronoun that as its
            antecedent.
            That that dieth, let it die; and that that is to cut off, let it be
            cut off. Zech. xi. 9.</p>
            <p>4. As a conjunction, that retains much of its force as a
            demonstrative pronoun. It is used, specifically: —
            (a) To introduce a clause employed as the object of the preceding
            verb, or as the subject or predicate nominative of a verb.
            She tells them 't is a causeless fantasy, And childish error, that
            they are afraid. Shak.
            I have shewed before, that a mere possibility to the contrary, can by
            no means hinder a thing from being highly credible. Bp. Wilkins.</p>
            <p>(b) To introduce, a reason or cause; — equivalent to for that, in
            that, for the reason that, because.
            He does hear me; And that he does, I weep. Shak.</p>
            <p>(c) To introduce a purpose; — usually followed by may, or might, and
            frequently preceded by so, in order, to the end, etc.
            These things I say, that ye might be saved. John v. 34.
            To the end that he may prolong his days. Deut. xvii. 20.</p>
            <p>(d) To introduce a consequence, result, or effect; — usually
            preceded by so or such, sometimes by that.
            The birds their notes renew, and bleating herds Attest their joy,
            that hill and valley rings. Milton.
            He gazed so long That both his eyes were dazzled. Tennyson.
            (e) To introduce a clause denoting time; — equivalent to in which
            time, at which time, when.
            So wept Duessa until eventide, That shining lamps in Jove's high
            course were lit. Spenser.
            Is not this the day That Hermia should give answer of her choice
            Shak.</p>
            <p>(f) In an elliptical sentence to introduce a dependent sentence
            expressing a wish, or a cause of surprise, indignation, or the like.
            Ha, cousin Silence, that thou hadst seen that that this knight and I
            have seen! Shak.
            O God, that right should thus overcome might! Shak.</p>
            <p>Note: That was formerly added to other conjunctions or to adverbs to
            make them emphatic.
            To try if that our own be ours or no. Shak.
            That is sometimes used to connect a clause with a preceding
            conjunction on which it depends.
            When he had carried Rome and that we looked For no less spoil than
            glory. Shak.</p>
            <p>5. As adverb: To such a degree; so; as, he was that frightened he
            could say nothing. [Archaic or in illiteral use.] All that,
            everything of that kind; all that sort.
            With singing, laughing, ogling, and all that. Pope.
            The rank is but the guinea's stamp, The man's the gowd [gold] for
            a'that. Burns.
            — For that. See under For, prep.
             — In that. See under In, prep.</p>

            or contemplation, without a view to practice; hypothesis;
            speculation.</p>
            <p>Note: "This word is employed by English writers in a very loose and
            improper sense. It is with them usually convertible into hypothesis,
            and hypothesis is commonly used as another term for conjecture. The
            terms theory and theoretical are properly used in opposition to the
            terms practice and practical. In this sense, they were exclusively
            employed by the ancients; and in this sense, they are almost
            exclusively employed by the Continental philosophers." Sir W.

            <p>Syn.
             — Hypothesis, speculation.

            some ancient Platonists, or by the chemical processes of the German
            fire philosophers; also, a direct, as distinguished from a revealed,
            knowledge of God, supposed to be attained by extraordinary

             — Thoughtful, Considerate. He who is habitually thoughtful rarely
            neglects his duty or his true interest; he who is considerate pauses
            to reflect and guard himself against error. One who is not thoughtful
            by nature, if he can be made considerate, will usually be guarded
            against serious mistakes. "He who is thoughtful does not forget his
            duty; he who is considerate pauses, and considers properly what is
            his duty. It is a recommendation to a subordinate person to be
            thoughtful in doing what is wished of him; it is the recommendation
            of a confidential person to be considerate, as he has often Crabb.

            <p>2. The alternate rising and falling of the waters of the ocean, and
            of bays, rivers, etc., connected therewith. The tide ebbs and flows
            twice in each lunar day, or the space of a little more than twenty-
            four hours. It is occasioned by the attraction of the sun and moon
            (the influence of the latter being three times that of the former),
            acting unequally on the waters in different parts of the earth, thus
            disturbing their equilibrium. A high tide upon one side of the earth
            is accompanied by a high tide upon the opposite side. Hence, when the
            sun and moon are in conjunction or opposition, as at new moon and
            full moon, their action is such as to produce a greater than the
            usual tide, called the spring tide, as represented in the cut. When
            the moon is in the first or third quarter, the sun's attraction in
            part counteracts the effect of the moon's attraction, thus producing
            under the moon a smaller tide than usual, called the neap tide.</p>
            <p>Note: The flow or rising of the water is called flood tide, and the
            reflux, ebb tide.</p>
            <p>3. A stream; current; flood; as, a tide of blood. "Let in the tide of

            leads on to fortune. Shak.</p>

            <p>6. (Mining)</p>
            <p>Defn: The period of twelve hours. Atmospheric tides, tidal movements
            of the atmosphere similar to those of the ocean, and produced in the
            same manner by the attractive forces of the sun and moon.

             — Tide day, the interval between the occurrences of two consecutive
            maxima of the resultant wave at the same place. Its length varies as
            the components of sun and moon waves approach to, or recede from, one
            another. A retardation from this cause is called the lagging of the
            tide, while the acceleration of the recurrence of high water is
            termed the priming of the tide. See Lag of the tide, under 2d Lag.
             — Tide dial, a dial to exhibit the state of the tides at any time.
             — Tide gate. (a) An opening through which water may flow freely

            (Naut.) A place where the tide runs with great velocity, as through a
            gate.

            especially, a contrivance for registering the state of the tide
            continuously at every instant of time. Brande &amp; C.
             — Tide lock, a lock situated between an inclosed basin, or a canal,
            and the tide water of a harbor or river, when they are on different
            levels, so that craft can pass either way at all times of the tide; -
            - called also guard lock.
             — Tide mill. (a) A mill operated by the tidal currents. (b) A mill

            <p>Syn.
             — Temporizing.
             — Timeserving, Temporizing. Both these words are applied to the
            conduct of one who adapts himself servilely to times and seasons. A
            timeserver is rather active, and a temporizer, passive. One whose
            policy is timeserving comes forward to act upon principles or
            opinions which may promote his advancement; one who is temporizing
            yields to the current of public sentiment or prejudice, and shrinks
            from a course of action which might injure him with others. The
            former is dishonest; the latter is weak; and both are contemptible.
            Trimming and timeserving, which are but two words for the same thing,
            . . . produce confusion. South.

            comprising the Koluschan stock. Previous to deterioration from
            contact with the whites they were the foremost traders of the
            northwest. They built substantial houses of cedar adorned with  totem
            poles, and were expert stone carvers and copper workers. Slavery, the
            potlatch, and the use of immense labrets were characteristic. Many
            now work in the salmon industry.</p>
            <p>TMESIS<br>
            Tme"sis, n. Etym: [L., from Gr. (Gram.)
            </p>
            <p>Defn: The separation of the parts of a compound word by the
            intervention of one or more words; as, in what place soever, for
            whatsoever place.</p>
            <p>TO-
            To- (, see To, prep.) Etym: [AS. to- asunder; akin to G. zer-, and
            perhaps to L. dis-, or Gr.</p>
            <p>Defn: An obsolete intensive prefix used in the formation of compound
            verbs; as in to-beat, to-break, to-hew, to-rend, to-tear. See these
            words in the Vocabulary. See the Note on All to, or All-to, under
            All, adv.</p>
            <p>TO
            To (emphatic or alone, obscure or unemphatic), prep. Etym: [AS. to;
            akin to OS. &amp; OFries. to, D. toe, G. zu, OHG. zuo, zua, zo, Russ. do,
            Ir. &amp; Gael. do, OL. -do, -du, as in endo, indu, in, Gr. Too, Tatoo a
            beat of drums.]</p>
            <p>1. The preposition to primarily indicates approach and arrival,
            motion made in the direction of a place or thing and attaining it,
            access; and also, motion or tendency without arrival; movement
            toward; — opposed to Ant: from. "To Canterbury they wend." Chaucer.
            Stay with us, go not to Wittenberg. Shak.
            So to the sylvan lodge They came, that like Pomona's arbor smiled.
            Milton.
            I'll to him again, . . . He'll tell me all his purpose. She stretched
            her arms to heaven. Dryden.</p>
            <p>2. Hence, it indicates motion, course, or tendency toward a time, a
            state or condition, an aim, or anything capable of being regarded as
            a limit to a tendency, movement, or action; as, he is going to a
            trade; he is rising to wealth and honor.</p>
            <p>Note: Formerly, by omission of the verb denoting motion, to sometimes
            followed a form of be, with the sense of at, or in. "When the sun was
            [gone or declined] to rest." Chaucer.</p>
            <p>3. In a very general way, and with innumerable varieties of
            application, to connects transitive verbs with their remoter or
            indirect object, and adjectives, nouns, and neuter or passive verbs
            with a following noun which limits their action. Its sphere verges
            upon that of for, but it contains less the idea of design or
            appropriation; as, these remarks were addressed to a large audience;
            let us keep this seat to ourselves; a substance sweet to the taste;
            an event painful to the mind; duty to God and to our parents; a
            dislike to spirituous liquor.
            Marks and points out each man of us to slaughter. B. Jonson.
            Whilst they, distilled Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand
            dumb and speak not to him. Shak.
            Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge
            temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;
            and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness
            charity. 2 Pet. i. 5,6,7.
            I have a king's oath to the contrary. Shak.
            Numbers were crowded to death. Clarendon.
            Fate and the dooming gods are deaf to tears. Dryden.
            Go, buckle to the law. Dryden.</p>
            <p>4. As sign of the infinitive, to had originally the use of last
            defined, governing the infinitive as a verbal noun, and connecting it
            as indirect object with a preceding verb or adjective; thus, ready to
            go, i.e., ready unto going; good to eat, i.e., good for eating; I do
            my utmost to lead my life pleasantly. But it has come to be the
            almost constant prefix to the infinitive, even in situations where it
            has no prepositional meaning, as where the infinitive is direct
            object or subject; thus, I love to learn, i.e., I love learning; to
            die for one's country is noble, i.e., the dying for one's country.
            Where the infinitive denotes the design or purpose, good usage
            formerly allowed the prefixing of for to the to; as, what went ye out
            for see (Matt. xi. 8).
            Then longen folk to go on pilgrimages, And palmers for to seeken
            strange stranders. Chaucer.</p>
            <p>Note: Such usage is now obsolete or illiterate. In colloquial usage,
            to often stands for, and supplies, an infinitive already mentioned;
            thus, he commands me to go with him, but I do not wish to.</p>
            <p>5. In many phrases, and in connection with many other words, to has a
            pregnant meaning, or is used elliptically. Thus, it denotes or
            implies:
            (a) Extent; limit; degree of comprehension; inclusion as far as; as,
            they met us to the number of three hundred.
            We ready are to try our fortunes To the last man. Shak.
            Few of the Esquimaux can count to ten. Quant. Rev.</p>
            <p>(b) Effect; end; consequence; as, the prince was flattered to his
            ruin; he engaged in a war to his cost; violent factions exist to the
            prejudice of the state.
            (c) Apposition; connection; antithesis; opposition; as, they engaged
            hand to hand.
            Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face. 1 Cor.
            xiii. 12.</p>
            <p>(d) Accord; adaptation; as, an occupation to his taste; she has a
            husband to her mind.
            He to God's image, she to his was made. Dryden.</p>
            <p>(e) Comparison; as, three is to nine as nine is to twenty-seven; it
            is ten to one that you will offend him.
            All that they did was piety to this. B. Jonson.</p>
            <p>(f) Addition; union; accumulation.
            Wisdom he has, and to his wisdom, courage. Denham.</p>
            <p>(g) Accompaniment; as, she sang to his guitar; they danced to the
            music of a piano.
            Anon they move In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood Of flutes and
            soft recorders. Milton.</p>
            <p>(h) Character; condition of being; purpose subserved or office
            filled. [In this sense archaic] "I have a king here to my flatterer."
            Shak.
            Made his masters and others . . . to consider him to a little wonder.
            Walton.</p>
            <p>Note: To in to-day, to-night, and to-morrow has the sense or force of
            for or on; for, or on, (this) day, for, or on, (this) night, for, or
            on, (the) morrow. To-day, to-night, to-morrow may be considered as
            compounds, and usually as adverbs; but they are sometimes used as
            nouns; as, to-day is ours.
            To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow; Creeps in this petty pace
            from day to day. Shak.
            To and again, to and fro. [R.] — To and fro, forward and back. In
            this phrase, to is adverbial.
            There was great showing both to and fro. Chaucer.
            — To-and-fro, a pacing backward and forward; as, to commence a to-
            and-fro. Tennyson.
             — To the face, in front of; in behind; hence, in the presence of.
             — To wit, to know; namely. See Wit, v. i.</p>
            <p>Note: To, without an object expressed, is used adverbially; as, put
            to the door, i. e., put the door to its frame, close it; and in the
            nautical expressions, to heave to, to come to, meaning to a certain
            position. To, like on, is sometimes used as a command, forward, set
            to. "To, Achilles! to, Ajax! to!" Shak.</p>
            <p>TOAD<br>
            Toad, n. Etym: [OE. tode, tade, AS. tadie, tadige; of unknown origin.<br>
            Cf. Tadpole.] (Zoöl.)
            </p>
            <p>Defn: Any one of numerous species of batrachians belonging to the
            genus Bufo and allied genera, especially those of the family
            Bufonidæ. Toads are generally terrestrial in their habits except
            during the breeding season, when they seek the water. Most of the
            species burrow beneath the earth in the daytime and come forth to
            feed on insects at night. Most toads have a rough, warty skin in
            which are glands that secrete an acrid fluid.</p>
            <p>Note: The common toad (Bufo vulgaris) and the natterjack are familiar
            European species. The common American toad (B. lentiginosus) is
            similar to the European toad, but is less warty and is more active,
            moving chiefly by leaping. Obstetrical toad. (Zoöl.) See under

            alleged practice among mountebanks' boys of eating toads (popularly
            supposed to be poisonous), in order that their masters might have an
            opportunity of pretending to effect a cure. The French equivalent
            expression is un avaleur de couleuvres. Cf. Toady.]</p>

            <p>TONE<br>
            Tone, n. Etym: [F. ton, L. tonus a sound, tone, fr. Gr. Thin, and cf.<br>
            Monotonous, Thunder, Ton fasion,Tune.]
            </p>
            <p>1. Sound, or the character of a sound, or a sound considered as of
            this or that character; as, a low, high, loud, grave, acute, sweet,
            or harsh tone.
            [Harmony divine] smooths her charming tones. Milton.
            Tones that with seraph hymns might blend. Keble.</p>
            <p>2. (Rhet.)</p>
            <p>Defn: Accent, or inflection or modulation of the voice, as adapted to
            express emotion or passion.
            Eager his tone, and ardent were his eyes. Dryden.</p>
            <p>3. A whining style of speaking; a kind of mournful or artificial
            strain of voice; an affected speaking with a measured rhythm ahd a
            regular rise and fall of the voice; as, children often read with a
            tone.</p>
            <p>4. (Mus.)
            (a) A sound considered as to pitch; as, the seven tones of the
            octave; she has good high tones.
            (b) The larger kind of interval between contiguous sounds in the
            diatonic scale, the smaller being called a semitone as, a whole tone
            too flat; raise it a tone.
            (c) The peculiar quality of sound in any voice or instrument; as, a
            rich tone, a reedy tone.
            (d) A mode or tune or plain chant; as, the Gregorian tones.</p>
            <p>Note: The use of the word tone, both for a sound and for the interval
            between two sounds or tones, is confusing, but is common — almost
            universal.</p>
            <p>Note: Nearly every musical sound is composite, consisting of several
            simultaneous tones having different rates of vibration according to
            fixed laws, which depend upon the nature of the vibrating body and
            the mode of excitation. The components (of a composite sound) are
            called partial tones; that one having the lowest rate of vibration is
            the fundamental tone, and the other partial tones are called
            harmonics, or overtones. The vibration ratios of the partial tones
            composing any sound are expressed by all, or by a part, of the
            numbers in the series 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.; and the quality of any
            sound (the tone color) is due in part to the presence or absence of
            overtones as represented in this series, and in part to the greater
            or less intensity of those present as compared with the fundamental
            tone and with one another. Resultant tones, combination tones,
            summation tones, difference tones, Tartini's tones (terms only in
            part synonymous) are produced by the simultaneous sounding of two or
            more primary (simple or composite) tones.</p>

            <p>Defn: That state of a body, or of any of its organs or parts, in

            Ton*tine" in*su"rance. (Life Insurance)
            </p>
            <p>Defn: Insurance in which the benefits of the insurance are
            distributed upon the tontine principle. Under the old, or full
            tontine, plan, all benefits were forfeited on lapsed policies, on the
            policies of those who died within the tontine period only the face of
            the policy was paid without any share of the surplus, and the
            survivor at the end of the tontine period received the entire
            surplus. This plan of tontine insurance has been replaced in the
            United States by the semitontine plan, in which the surplus is
            divided among the holders of policies in force at the termination of
            the tontine period, but the reverse for the paid-up value is paid on
            lapsed policies, and on the policies of those that have died the face
            is paid. Other modified forms are called free tontine, deferred
            dividend, etc., according to the nature of the tontine arrangement.</p>

            <p>1. (Anat.)</p>
            <p>Defn: One of the hard, bony appendages which are borne on the jaws,
            or on other bones in the walls of the mouth or pharynx of most
            vertebrates, and which usually aid in the prehension and mastication
            of food.</p>
            <p>Note: The hard parts of teeth are principally made up of dentine, or
            ivory, and a very hard substance called enamel. These are variously
            combined in different animals. Each tooth consist of three parts, a
            crown, or body, projecting above the gum, one or more fangs imbedded
            in the jaw, and the neck, or intermediate part. In some animals one
            or more of the teeth are modified into tusks which project from the
            mouth, as in both sexes of the elephant and of the walrus, and in the
            male narwhal. In adult man there are thirty-two teeth, composed
            largely of dentine, but the crowns are covered with enamel, and the
            fangs with a layer of bone called cementum. Of the eight teeth on
            each half of each jaw, the two in front are incisors, then come one
            canine, cuspid, or dog tooth, two bicuspids, or false molars, and
            three molars, or grinding teeth. The milk, or temporary, teeth are
            only twenty in number, there being two incisors, one canine, and two
            molars on each half of each jaw. The last molars, or wisdom teeth,
            usually appear long after the others, and occasionally do not appear
            above the jaw at all.

            in the produce of land, in manufactures, in bills, or in money; but
            it is chiefly used to denote the barter or purchase and sale of
            goods, wares, and merchandise, either by wholesale or retail. Trade
            is either foreign or domestic. Foreign trade consists in the
            exportation and importation of goods, or the exchange of the
            commodities of different countries. Domestic, or home, trade is the
            exchange, or buying and selling, of goods within a country. Trade is
            also by the wholesale, that is, by the package or in large
            quantities, generally to be sold again, or it is by retail, or in
            small parcels. The carrying trade is the business of transporting

            same country, by land or water.</p>

            learned professions, and agriculture; as, we speak of the trade of a
            smith, of a carpenter, or mason, but not now of the trade of a
            farmer, or a lawyer, or a physician.

             — Trade wind, a wind in the torrid zone, and often a little beyond
            at, which blows from the same quarter throughout the year, except
            when affected by local causes; — so called because of its usefulness
            to navigators, and hence to trade.</p>
            <p>Note: The general direction of the trade winds is from N. E. to S. W.
            on the north side of the equator, and from S. E. to N. W. on the
            south side of the equator. They are produced by the joint effect of
            the rotation of the earth and the movement of the air from the polar
            toward the equatorial regions, to supply the vacancy caused by
            heating, rarefaction, and consequent ascent of the air in the latter
            regions. The trade winds are principally limited to two belts in the
            tropical regions, one on each side of the equator, and separated by a
            belt which is characterized by calms or variable weather.</p>

            <p>Syn.
             — Transcendental, Empirical. These terms, with the corresponding
            nouns, transcendentalism and empiricism, are of comparatively recent
            origin. Empirical refers to knowledge which is gained by the
            experience of actual phenomena, without reference to the principles
            or laws to which they are to be referred, or by which they are to be
            explained. Transcendental has reference to those beliefs or
            principles which are not derived from experience, and yet are
            absolutely necessary to make experience possible or useful. Such, in
            the better sense of the term, is the transcendental philosophy, or
            transcendentalism. Each of these words is also used in a bad sense,
            empiricism applying to that one-sided view of knowledge which
            neglects or loses sight of the truths or principles referred to
            above, and trusts to experience alone; transcendentalism, to the
            opposite extreme, which, in its deprecation of experience, loses
            sight of the relations which facts and phenomena sustain to
            principles, and hence to a kind of philosophy, or a use of language,
            which is vague, obscure, fantastic, or extravagant.</p>

            <p>TRANSCENDENTALISM
            Tran`scen*den"tal*ism, n. Etym: [Cf. F. transcendantalisme, G.
            transcendentalismus.]</p>
            <p>1. (Kantian Philos.)</p>
            <p>Defn: The transcending, or going beyond, empiricism, and ascertaining
            a priori the fundamental principles of human knowledge.</p>
            <p>Note: As Schelling and Hegel claim to have discovered the absolute
            identity of the objective and subjective in human knowledge, or of
            things and human conceptions of them, the Kantian distinction between
            transcendent and transcendental ideas can have no place in their
            philosophy; and hence, with them, transcendentalism claims to have a
            true knowledge of all things, material and immaterial, human and
            divine, so far as the mind is capable of knowing them. And in this
            sense the word transcendentalism is now most used. It is also
            sometimes used for that which is vague and illusive in philosophy.</p>

            <p>Defn: A theory of the development of mammalian molar teeth. The
            primitive stage is that of simple cones, as in reptiles. The simple
            cone then developed a smaller cone in front and another behind. Next,
            a cingulum was developed, and the three cones became arranged in a
            triangle, the two smaller cusps having moved to the outer side in
            upper and to the inner in lower molars. This primitive triangle is
            called the trigon or trigonid and this stage the tritubercular or
            trigonodont. The trigon being a cutting apparatus, an extension of
            the posterior part of the crown was developed in lower molars for
            crushing, and a smaller corresponding part appeared in upper molars.
            Another large cone then arose, usually from the cingulum. In more
            complex forms, smaller intermediate cusps appeared.</p>

            <p>Defn: A compound crystal composed of two or more crystals, or parts
            of crystals, in reversed position with reference to each other.</p>
            <p>Note: The relative position of the parts of a twin may be explained
            by supposing one part to be revolved 180º about a certain axis
            (called the twinning axis), this axis being normal to a plane (called
            the twinning plane) which is usually one of the fundamental planes of
            the crystal. This revolution brings the two parts into parallel
            position, or vice versa. A contact twin is one in which the parts are
            united by a plane surface, called the composition face, which is
            usually the same as the twinning plane. A penetration twin is one in
            which the parts interpenetrate each other, often very irregularly.
            Twins are also called, according to form, cruciform, geniculated,
            etc.</p>

            other compounds are conveniently regarded as being related, and from
            which they may be actually or theoretically derived.</p>
            <p>Note: The fundamental types used to express the simplest and most

            <p>5. (Typog.)
            (a) A raised letter, figure, accent, or other character, cast in
            metal or cut in wood, used in printing.
            (b) Such letters or characters, in general, or the whole quantity of
            them used in printing, spoken of collectively; any number or mass of
            such letters or characters, however disposed.</p>
            <p>Note: Type are mostly made by casting type metal in a mold, though
            some of the larger sizes are made from maple, mahogany, or boxwood.
            In the cut, a is the body; b, the face, or part from which the
            impression is taken; c, the shoulder, or top of the body; d, the nick
            (sometimes two or more are made), designed to assist the compositor
            in distinguishing the bottom of the face from the top; e, the groove
            made in the process of finishing, — each type as cast having
            attached to the bottom of the body a jet, or small piece of metal
            (formed by the surplus metal poured into the mold), which, when
            broken off, leaves a roughness that requires to be removed. The fine
            lines at the top and bottom of a letter are technically called
            ceriphs, and when part of the face projects over the body, as in the
            letter f, the projection is called a kern. The type which compose an
            ordinary book font consist of Roman CAPITALS, small capitals, and
            lower-case letters, and Italic CAPITALS and lower-case letters, with
            accompanying figures, points, and reference marks, — in all about
            two hundred characters. Including the various modern styles of fancy
            type, some three or four hundred varieties of face are made. Besides
            the ordinary Roman and Italic, some of the most important of the
            varieties are —
            Old English. Black Letter. Old Style. French Elzevir. Boldface.
            Antique. Clarendon. Gothic. Typewriter. Script. The smallest body in
            common use is diamond; then follow in order of size, pearl, agate,
            nonpareil, minion, brevier, bourgeois (or two-line diamond), long
            primer (or two-line pearl), small pica (or two-line agate), pica (or
            two-line nonpareil), English (or two-line minion), Columbian (or two-
            line brevier), great primer (two-line bourgeois), paragon (or two-
            line long primer), double small pica (or two-line small pica), double
            pica (or two-line pica), double English (or two-line English), double
            great primer (or two-line great primer), double paragon (or two-line
            paragon), canon (or two-line double pica). Above this, the sizes are
            called five-line pica, six-line pica, seven-line pica, and so on,
            being made mostly of wood. The following alphabets show the different
            sizes up to great primer.

            is conformed to the designations made use of by American type
            founders, but is substantially correct for England. Agate, however,
            is called ruby, in England, where, also, a size intermediate between
            nonpareil and minion is employed, called emerald. Point system of
            type bodies (Type Founding), a system adopted by the type founders of
            the United States by which the various sizes of type have been so
            modified and changed that each size bears an exact proportional
            relation to every other size. The system is a modification of a
            French system, and is based on the pica body. This pica body is
            divided into twelfths, which are termed "points," and every type body
            consist of a given number of these points. Many of the type founders
            indicate the new sizes of type by the number of points, and the old
            names are gradually being done away with. By the point system type
            founders cast type of a uniform size and height, whereas formerly
            fonts of pica or other type made by different founders would often
            vary slightly so that they could not be used together. There are no
            type in actual use corresponding to the smaller theoretical sizes of
            the point system. In some cases, as in that of ruby, the term used
            designates a different size from that heretofore so called.

            "Sir," would he [Seneca] say, "an emperor mote need Be virtuous and

            <p>TYRANT

            <p>1. An absolute ruler; a sovereign unrestrained by law or
            constitution; a usurper of sovereignty.</p>
            <p>Note: Free governments [in Greece] having superseded the old
            hereditary sovereignties (basilei^ai), all who obtained absolute
            power in a state were called ty\rannoi, tyrants, or rather despots; -
            - for the term rather regards the irregular way in which the power
            was gained, whether force or fraud, than the way in which it was
            exercised, being applied to the mild Pisistratus, but not to the
            despotic kings of Persia. However, the word soon came to imply
            reproach, and was then used like our tyrant. Liddell &amp; Scott.</p>
            <p>2. Specifically, a monarch, or other ruler or master, who uses power
            to oppress his subjects; a person who exercises unlawful authority,
            or lawful authority in an unlawful manner; one who by taxation,
            injustice, or cruel punishment, or the demand of unreasonable
            services, imposes burdens and hardships on those under his control,
            which law and humanity do not authorize, or which the purposes of
            government do not require; a cruel master; an oppressor. "This false
            tyrant, this Nero." Chaucer.
            Love, to a yielding heart, is a king, but to a resisting, is a
            tyrant. Sir P. Sidney.</p>

            <p>Note: These birds are noted for their irritability and pugnacity, and

            them in size and strength. They are mostly plain-colored birds, but
            often have a bright-colored crown patch. A few species, as the
