            <p>Syn.
             — To cover; cloak; hide; extenuate; conceal.
             — To Palliate, Extenuate, Cloak. These words, as here compared, are
            used in a figurative sense in reference to our treatment of wrong
            action. We cloak in order to conceal completely. We extenuate a crime
            when we endeavor to show that it is less than has been supposed; we
            palliate a crime when we endeavor to cover or conceal its enormity,
            at least in part. This naturally leads us to soften some of its
            features, and thus palliate approaches extenuate till they have
            become nearly or quite identical. "To palliate is not now used,
            though it once was, in the sense of wholly cloaking or covering over,
            as it might be, our sins, but in that of extenuating; to palliate our
            faults is not to hide them altogether, but to seek to diminish their
            guilt in part." Trench.</p>

            trunk is usually erect and rarely branched, and has a roughened
            exterior composed of the persistent bases of the leaf stalks. The
            leaves are borne in a terminal crown, and are supported on stout,
            sheathing, often prickly, petioles. They are usually of great size,
            and are either pinnately or palmately many-cleft. There are about one
            thousand species known, nearly all of them growing in tropical or
            semitropical regions. The wood, petioles, leaves, sap, and fruit of
            many species are invaluable in the arts and in domestic economy.
            Among the best known are the date palm, the cocoa palm, the fan palm,
            the oil palm, the wax palm, the palmyra, and the various kinds called
            cabbage palm and palmetto.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Defn: An hypothesis advanced by Darwin in explanation of heredity.</p>
            <p>Note: The theory rests on the assumption, that the whole
            organization, in the sense of every separate atom or unit, reproduces
            itself, the cells throwing off minute granules called gemmules, which
            circulate freely throughout the system and multiply by subdivision.
            These gemmules collect in the reproductive organs and products, or in
            buds, so that the egg or bud contains gemmules from all parts of the
            parent or parents, which in development give rise to cells in the
            offspring similar to those from which they were given off in the
            parent. The hypothesis also assumes that these gemmules need not in
            all cases develop into cells, but may lie dormant, and be transmitted
            from generation to generation without producing a noticeable effect
            until a case of atavism occurs.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Syn: remission.</p>
            <p>Defn: — Forgiveness, Pardon. Forgiveness is Anglo-Saxon, and pardon
            Norman French, both implying a giving back. The word pardon, being
            early used in our Bible, has, in religious matters, the same sense as
            forgiveness; but in the language of common life there is a difference
            between them, such as we often find between corresponding Anglo-Saxon
            and Norman words. Forgive points to inward feeling, and suppose
            alienated affection; when we ask forgiveness, we primarily seek the
            removal of anger. Pardon looks more to outward things or
            consequences, and is often applied to trifling matters, as when we
            beg pardon for interrupting a man, or for jostling him in a crowd.
            The civil magistrate also grants a pardon, and not forgiveness. The
            two words are, therefore, very clearly distinguished from each other
            in most cases which relate to the common concerns of life.</p>

            The mind, in such cases, is considered as having lost its self-

             — To discern; distinguish; observe; see; feel; know; understand.
             — To Perceive, Discern. To perceive a thing is to apprehend it as
            presented to the senses or the intellect; to discern is to mark
            differences, or to see a thing as distinguished from others around
            it. We may perceive two persons afar off without being able to
            discern whether they are men or women. Hence, discern is often used
            of an act of the senses or the mind involving close, discriminating,
            analytical attention. We perceive that which is clear or obvious; we
            discern that which requires much attention to get an idea of it. "We
            perceive light, darkness, colors, or the truth or falsehood of
            anything. We discern characters, motives, the tendency and
            consequences of actions, etc." Crabb.</p>

            <p>Note: "The word perception is, in the language of philosophers
            previous to Reid, used in a very extensive signification. By
            Descartes, Malebranche, Locke, Leibnitz, and others, it is employed
            in a sense almost as unexclusive as consciousness, in its widest
            signification. By Reid this word was limited to our faculty
            acquisitive of knowledge, and to that branch of this faculty whereby,
            through the senses, we obtain a knowledge of the external world. But
            his limitation did not stop here. In the act of external perception
            he distinguished two elements, to which he gave the names of
            perception and sensation. He ought perhaps to have called these
            perception proper and sensation proper, when employed in his special
            meaning." Sir W. Hamilton.</p>

             — Periodic function (Math.), a function whose values recur at fixed
            intervals as the variable uniformly increases. The trigonomertic
            functions, as sin x, tan x, etc., are periodic functions. Exponential
            functions are also periodic, having an imaginary period, and the
            elliptic functions have not only a real but an imaginary period, and
            are hence called doubly periodic.
             — Periodic law (Chem.), the generalization that the properties of
            the chemical elements are periodic functions of their atomic wieghts.
            "In other words, if the elements are grouped in the order of their
            atomic weights, it will be found that nearly the same properties
            recur periodically throughout the entire series." The following
            tabular arrangement of the atomic weights shows the regular
            recurrence of groups (under I., II., III., IV., etc.), each
            consisting of members of the same natural family. The gaps in the
            table indicate the probable existence of unknown elements.

             — To Allow, Permit, Suffer, Tolerate. To allow is more positive,
            denoting (at least originally and etymologically) a decided assent,
            either directly or by implication. To permit is more negative, and
            imports only acquiescence or an abstinence from prevention. The
            distinction, however, is often disregarded by good writers. To suffer
            has a stronger passive or negative sense than to permit, sometimes
            implying against the will, sometimes mere indifference. To tolerate
            is to endure what is contrary to will or desire. To suffer and to
            tolerate are sometimes used without discrimination.</p>

            nature of things; to investigate phenomena, and assign rational

            Man philosophizes as he lives. He may philosophize well or ill, but
            philosophize he must. Sir W. Hamilton.</p>
            <p>PHILOSOPHIZER<br>

            <p>PHILOSOPHY
            Phi*los"o*phy, n.; pl. Philosophies. Etym: [OE. philosophie, F.
            philosophie, L. philosophia, from Gr. Philosopher.]</p>
            <p>1. Literally, the love of, including the search after, wisdom; in
            actual usage, the knowledge of phenomena as explained by, and
            resolved into, causes and reasons, powers and laws.</p>
            <p>Note: When applied to any particular department of knowledge,
            philosophy denotes the general laws or principles under which all the
            subordinate phenomena or facts relating to that subject are
            comprehended. Thus philosophy, when applied to God and the divine
            government, is called theology; when applied to material objects, it
            is called physics; when it treats of man, it is called anthropology
            and psychology, with which are connected logic and ethics; when it
            treats of the necessary conceptions and relations by which philosophy
            is possible, it is called metaphysics.</p>
            <p>Note: "Philosophy has been defined: tionscience of things divine and
            human, and the causes in which they are contained; — the science of
            effects by their causes; — the science of sufficient reasons; — the
            science of things possible, inasmuch as they are possible; — the
            science of things evidently deduced from first principles; — the
            science of truths sensible and abstract; — the application of reason
            to its legitimate objects; — the science of the relations of all
            knowledge to the necessary ends of human reason; — the science of
            the original form of the ego, or mental self; — the science of
            science; — the science of the absolute; — the scienceof the
            absolute indifference of the ideal and real." Sir W. Hamilton.</p>
            <p>2. A particular philosophical system or theory; the hypothesis by
            which particular phenomena are explained.

             — Philosophy of the Porch, that of Zeno and the Stoics; — so
            called because Zeno of Citium and his successors taught in the porch
            of the Poicile, a great hall in Athens.</p>

            <p>PHOTOSYNTHESIS<br>
            Pho`to*syn"the*sis, n. (Plant Physiol.)
            </p>
            <p>Defn: The process of constructive metabolism by which carbohydrates
            are formed from water vapor and the carbon dioxide of the air in the
            chlorophyll-containing tissues of plants exposed to the action of
            light. It was formerly called assimilation, but this is now commonly
            used as in animal physiology. The details of the process are not yet
            clearly known. Baeyer's theory is that the carbon dioxide is reduced
            to carbon monoxide, which, uniting with the hydrogen of the water in
            the cell, produces formaldehyde, the latter forming various sugars
            through polymerization. Vines suggests that the carbohydrates are
            secretion products of the chloroplasts, derived from decomposition of
            previously formed proteids. The food substances are usually quickly
            translocated, those that accumulate being changed to starch, which
            appears in the cells almost simultaneously with the sugars. The
            chloroplasts perform photosynthesis only in light and within a
            certain range of temperature, varying according to climate. This is
            the only way in which a plant is able to organize carbohydrates. All
            plants without a chlorophyll apparatus, as the fungi, must be
            parasitic or saprophytic. —Pho`to*syn*thet"ic (#), a. —

            planets are Mercury and Venus, which are nearer to the sun than is
            the earth; the superior planets are Mars, the asteroids, Jupiter,
            Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, which are farther from the sun than is
            the earth. Primary planets are those which revolve about the sun;
            secondary planets, or moons, are those which revolve around the
            primary planets as satellites, and at the same time revolve with them
            about the sun.</p>

            Plant, n. Etym: [AS. plante, L. planta.]
            </p>
            <p>1. A vegetable; an organized living being, generally without feeling
            and voluntary motion, and having, when complete, a root, stem, and
            leaves, though consisting sometimes only of a single leafy expansion,
            or a series of cellules, or even a single cellule.</p>
            <p>Note: Plants are divided by their structure and methods of
            reproduction into two series, phænogamous or flowering plants, which
            have true flowers and seeds, and cryptogamous or flowerless plants,
            which have no flowers, and reproduce by minute one-celled spores. In
            both series are minute and simple forms and others of great size and
            complexity. As to their mode of nutrition, plants may be considered
            as self-supporting and dependent. Self-supporting plants always
            contain chlorophyll, and subsist on air and moisture and the matter
            dissolved in moisture, and as a general rule they excrete oxygen, and
            use the carbonic acid to combine with water and form the material for
            their tissues. Dependent plants comprise all fungi and many flowering
            plants of a parasitic or saprophytic nature. As a rule, they have no
            chlorophyll, and subsist mainly or wholly on matter already
            organized, thus utilizing carbon compounds already existing, and not
            excreting oxygen. But there are plants which are partly dependent and
            partly self-supporting. The movements of climbing plants, of some
            insectivorous plants, of leaves, stamens, or pistils in certain
            plants, and the ciliary motion of zoöspores, etc., may be considered
            a kind of voluntary motion.</p>

            plant of stubborn oak." Dryden.</p>

            </p>
            <p>1. The doctrines or philosophy by Plato or of his followers.</p>
            <p>Note: Plato believed God to be an infinitely wise, just, and powerful
            Spirit; and also that he formed the visible universe out of
            preëxistent amorphous matter, according to perfect patterns of ideas
            eternally existent in his own mind. Philosophy he considered as being
            a knowledge of the true nature of things, as discoverable in those
            eternal ideas after which all things were fashioned. In other words,
            it is the knowledge of what is eternal, exists necessarily, and is
            unchangeable; not of the temporary, the dependent, and changeable;
            and of course it is not obtained through the senses; neither is it
            the product of the understanding, which concerns itself only with the
            variable and transitory; nor is it the result of experience and
            observation; but it is the product of our reason, which, as partaking
            of the divine nature, has innate ideas resembling the eternal ideas
            of God. By contemplating these innate ideas, reasoning about them,
            and comparing them with their copies in the visible universe, reason
            can attain that true knowledge of things which is called philosophy.
            Plato's professed followers, the Academics, and the New Platonists,
            differed considerably from him, yet are called Platonists. Murdock.</p>

            Pok"er, n. Etym: [Of uncertain etymol.]
            </p>
            <p>Defn: A game at cards derived from brag, and first played about 1835
            in the Southwestern United States. Johnson's Cyc.</p>
            <p>Note: A poker hand is played with a poker deck, composed of fifty-two
            cards, of thirteeen values, each card value being represented once in
            each of four "suits", namely spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs. The
            game is played in many variations, but almost invariably the stage of
            decision as to who wins occurs when each player has five cards (or
            chooses five cards from some larger number available to him). The
            winner usually is the player with the highest-valued hand, but, in
            some variations, the winner may be the player with the lowest-valued
            hand. The value of a hand is ranked by hand types, representing the
            relationships of the cards to each other. [The hand types are ranked
            by the probability of receiving such a hand when dealt five cards.]
            Within each hand type the value is also ranked by the values of the
            cards. The hand types are labeled, in decreasing value: five of a
            kind; royal flush; straight flush; four of a kind; full house (coll.
            full boat, or boat); flush; straight; three of a kind; two pairs; one
            pair; and, when the contending players have no hands of any of the
            above types, the player with the highest-valued card wins — if there
            is a tie, the next-highest-valued card of the tied players determines
            the winner, and so on. If two players have the same type of hand, the
            value of the cards within each type determines the winner; thus, if
            two players both have three of a kind (and no other player has a
            higher type of hand), the player whose three matched cards have the
            highest card value is the winner.</p>

             — Polar body, cell, or globule (Biol.), a minute cell which
            separates by karyokinesis from the ovum during its maturation. In the
            maturation of ordinary ova two polar bodies are formed, but in

            larger than the second one, and often divides into two after its
            separation from the ovum. Each of the polar bodies removes maternal
            chromatin from the ovum to make room for the chromatin of the
            fertilizing spermatozoön; but their functions are not fully
            understood.

            two tangents drawn from a given point to a given conic section. The
            given point is called the pole of the line. If the given point lies
            within the curve so that the two tangents become imaginary, there is
            still a real polar line which does not meet the curve, but which
            possesses other properties of the polar. Thus the focus and directrix
            are pole and polar. There are also poles and polar curves to curves
            of higher degree than the second, and poles and polar planes to
            surfaces of the second degree.</p>

            <p>1. The act of polarizing; the state of being polarized, or of having
            polarity.</p>
            <p>2. (Opt.)</p>
            <p>Defn: A peculiar affection or condition of the rays of light or heat,
            in consequence of which they exhibit different properties in
            different directions.</p>
            <p>Note: If a beam of light, which has been reflected from a plate of
            unsilvered glass at an angle of about 56°, be received upon a second
            plate of glass similar to the former, and at the same angle of
            incidence, the light will be readily reflected when the two planes of
            incidence are parallel to each other, but will not be reflected when
            the two planes of incidence are perpendicular to each other. The
            light has, therefore, acquired new properties by reflection from the
            first plate of glass, and is called polarized light, while the
            modification which the light has experienced by this reflection is
            called polarization. The plane in which the beam of light is
            reflected from the first mirror is called the plane of polarization.
            The angle of polarization is the angle at which a beam of light must
            be reflected, in order that the polarization may be the most
            complete. The term polarization was derived from the theory of
            emission, and it was conceived that each luminous molecule has two
            poles analogous to the poles of a magnet; but this view is not now
            held. According to the undulatory theory, ordinary light is produced
            by vibrations transverse or perpendicular to the direction of the
            ray, and distributed as to show no distinction as to any particular
            direction. But when, by any means, these, vibrations are made to take
            place in one plane, the light is said to be plane polarized. If only
            a portion of the vibrations lie in one plane the ray is said to be
            partially polarized. Light may be polarized by several methods other
            than by reflection, as by refraction through most crystalline media,
            or by being transmitted obliquely through several plates of glass
            with parallel faces. If a beam of polarized light be transmitted
            through a crystal of quartz in the direction of its axis, the plane
            of polarization will be changed by an angle proportional to the
            thickness of the crystal. This phenomenon is called rotatory
            polarization. A beam of light reflected from a metallic surface, or
            from glass surfaces under certain peculiar conditions, acquires
            properties still more complex, its vibrations being no longer
            rectilinear, but circular, or elliptical. This phenomenon is called
            circular or elliptical polarization.</p>
            <p>3. (Elec.)</p>
            <p>Defn: An effect produced upon the plates of a voltaic battery, or the
            electrodes in an electrolytic cell, by the deposition upon them of
            the gases liberated by the action of the current. It is chiefly due
            to the hydrogen, and results in an increase of the resistance, and
            the setting up of an opposing electro-motive force, both of which
            tend materially to weaken the current of the battery, or that passing
            through the cell.</p>

            <p>POLICE POWER<br>
            Police power. (Law)
            </p>
            <p>Defn: The inherent power of a government to regulate its police
            affairs. The term police power is not definitely fixed in meaning. In
            the earlier cases in the United States it was used as including the
            whole power of internal government, or the powers of government
            inherent in every sovereignty to the extent of its dominions (11
            Peters (U. S.) 102). The later cases have excepted from its domain
            the development and administration of private law. Modern political
            science defines the power as a branch of internal administration in
            the exercise of which the executive should move within the lines of
            general principles prescribed by the constitution or the legislature,
            and in the exercise of which the most local governmental
            organizations should participate as far as possible (Burgess). Under
            this limitation the police power, as affecting persons, is the power
            of the state to protect the public against the abuse of individual
            liberty, that is, to restrain the individual in the exercise of his
            rights when such exercise becomes a danger to the community. The
            tendency of judicial and popular usage is towards this narrower
            definition.</p>

            deals only with positives. It excludes from philosophy everything but
            the natural phenomena or properties of knowable things, together with
            their invariable relations of coexistence and succession, as
            occurring in time and space. Such relations are denominated laws,
            which are to be discovered by observation, experiment, and
            comparison. This philosophy holds all inquiry into causes, both
            efficient and final, to be useless and unprofitable.</p>

            <p>POST-IMPRESSIONISM<br>
            Post`-im*pres"sion*ism, n. (Painting)
            </p>
            <p>Defn: In the broadest sense, the theory or practice of any of several
            groups of recent painters, or of these groups taken collectively,
            whose work and theories have in common a tendency to reaction against
            the scientific and naturalistic character of impressionism and neo-
            impressionism. In a strict sense the term post-impressionism is used
            to denote the effort at self-expression, rather than representation,
            shown in the work of Cézanne, Matisse, etc.; but it is more broadly
            used to include cubism, the theory or practice of a movement in both
            painting and  sculpture which lays stress upon volume as the
            important attribute of objects and attempts its expression by the use
            of geometrical figures or solids only; and futurism, a theory or
            practice which attempts to place the observer within the picture and
            to represent simultaneously a number of consecutive movements and
            impressions. In practice these theories and methods of the post-
            impressionists change with great rapidity and shade into one another,
            so that a picture may be both cubist and futurist in character. They
            tend to, and sometimes reach, a condition in which both
            representation and traditional decoration are entirely abolished and
            a work of art becomes a purely subjective expression in an arbitrary
            and personal language.</p>

            who equivocate uses words which have a double meaning, so that in one
            sense he can claim to have said the truth, though he does in fact
            deceive, and intends to do it. He who prevaricates talks all round
            the question, hoping to "dodge" it, and disclose nothing.</p>

            privileges, to the exclusion of others. It is the privilege of a

            that within which, taken positively and negatively, there is an even
            chance that the real error shall lie. Thus, if 3" is the probable
            error in a given case, the chances that the real error is greater
            than 3" are equal to the chances that it is less. The probable error
            is computed from the observations made, and is used to express their
            degree of accuracy.

            that which is inherent in a subject, or naturally essential to it; an
            attribute; as, sweetness is a property of sugar.

            frequently used as coextensive with quality in general. Sir W.
            Hamilton.</p>
            <p>Note: In physical science, the properties of matter are distinguished
            to the three following classes: 1. Physical properties, or those
            which result from the relations of bodies to the physical agents,
            light, heat, electricity, gravitation, cohesion, adhesion, etc., and
            which are exhibited without a change in the composition or kind of
            matter acted on. They are color, luster, opacity, transparency,
            hardness, sonorousness, density, crystalline form, solubility,
            capability of osmotic diffusion, vaporization, boiling, fusion, etc.
            2. Chemical properties, or those which are conditioned by affinity
            and composition; thus, combustion, explosion, and certain solutions
            are reactions occasioned by chemical properties. Chemical properties
            are identical when there is identity of composition and structure,
            and change according as the composition changes. 3. Organoleptic
            properties, or those forming a class which can not be included in
            either of the other two divisions. They manifest themselves in the
            contact of substances with the organs of taste, touch, and smell, or
            otherwise affect the living organism, as in the manner of medicines
            and poisons.</p>
            <p>2. An acquired or artificial quality; that which is given by art, or
            bestowed by man; as, the poem has the properties which constitute
            excellence.</p>
            <p>3. The exclusive right of possessing, enjoying, and disposing of a
            thing; ownership; title.

            Shall man assume a property in man Wordsworth.</p>
            <p>4. That to which a person has a legal title, whether in his
            possession or not; thing owned; an estate, whether in lands, goods,
            or money; as, a man of large property, or small property.</p>

            <p>5. (Math.)
            (a) The equality or similarity of ratios, especially of geometrical
            ratios; or a relation among quantities such that the quotient of the
            first divided by the second is equal to that of the third divided by
            the fourth; — called also geometrical proportion, in distinction
            from arithmetical proportion, or that in which the difference of the
            first and second is equal to the difference of the third and fourth.</p>
            <p>Note: Proportion in the mathematical sense differs from ratio. Ratio
            is the relation of two quantities of the same kind, as the ratio of 5
            to 10, or the ratio of 8 to 16. Proportion is the sameness or
            likeness of two such relations. Thus, 5 to 10 as 8 to 16; that is, 5
            bears the same relation to 10 as 8 does to 16. Hence, such numbers
            are said to be in proportion. Proportion is expressed by symbols
            thus: a:b::c:d, or a:b = c:d, or a/b = c/d.
            (b) The rule of three, in arithmetic, in which the three given terms,
            together with the one sought, are proportional. Continued proportion,
            Inverse proportion, etc. See under Continued, Inverse, etc.
             — Harmonical, or Musical, proportion, a relation of three or four
            quantities, such that the first is to the last as the difference
            between the first two is to the difference between the last two;
            thus, 2, 3, 6, are in harmonical proportion; for 2 is to 6 as 1 to 3.
            Thus, 24, 16, 12, 9, are harmonical, for 24:9::8:3.
             — In proportion, according as; to the degree that. "In proportion
            as they are metaphysically true, they are morally and politically
            false." Burke.</p>

            polanus, and F. poulain, properly, a colt, fr. L. pullus young
            animal, foal (cf. Pullet, Foal). For the change of sense, cf. F.
            poutre beam, originally, a filly, and E. easel.] (Mach.)</p>
            <p>Defn: A wheel with a broad rim, or grooved rim, for transmitting
            power from, or imparting power to, the different parts of machinery,
            or for changing the direction of motion, by means of a belt, cord,
            rope, or chain.</p>
            <p>Note: The pulley, as one of the mechanical powers, consists, in its
            simplest form, of a grooved wheel, called a sheave, turning within a
            movable frame or block, by means of a cord or rope attached at one
            end to a fixed point. The force, acting on the free end of the rope,
            is thus doubled, but can move the load through only half the space
            traversed by itself. The rope may also pass over a sheave in another
            block that is fixed. The end of the rope may be fastened to the
            movable block, instead of a fixed point, with an additional gain of
            power, and using either one or two sheaves in the fixed block. Other
            sheaves may be added, and the power multiplied accordingly. Such an
            apparatus is called by workmen a block and tackle, or a fall and
            tackle. See Block. A single fixed pulley gives no increase of power,
            but serves simply for changing the direction of motion. Band pulley,
            or Belt pulley, a pulley with a broad face for transmitting power
            between revolving shafts by means of a belt, or for guiding a belt.

             — Loose pulley, a pulley loose on a shaft, to interrupt the
            transmission of motion in machinery. See Fast and loose pulleys,
            under Fast. Parting pulley, a belt pulley made in semicircular
            halves, which can be bolted together, to facilitate application to,
            or removal from, a shaft.

            venarum), the beating of the pulse, the pulse, from pellere, pulsum,
            to beat, strike; cf. Gr. Appeal, Compel, Impel, Push.]</p>
            <p>1. (Physiol.)</p>
            <p>Defn: The beating or throbbing of the heart or blood vessels,
            especially of the arteries.</p>
            <p>Note: In an artery the pulse is due to the expansion and contraction
            of the elastic walls of the artery by the action of the heart upon
            the column of blood in the arterial system. On the commencement of
            the diastole of the ventricle, the semilunar valves are closed, and
            the aorta recoils by its elasticity so as to force part of its
            contents into the vessels farther onwards. These, in turn, as they
            already contain a certain quantity of blood, expand, recover by an
            elastic recoil, and transmit the movement with diminished intensity.
            Thus a series of movements, gradually diminishing in intensity, pass
            along the arterial system (see the Note under Heart). For the sake of
            convenience, the radial artery at the wrist is generally chosen to
            detect the precise character of the pulse. The pulse rate varies with
            age, position, sex, stature, physical and psychical influences, etc.</p>
            <p>2. Any measured or regular beat; any short, quick motion, regularly
            repeated, as of a medium in the transmission of light, sound, etc.;
            oscillation; vibration; pulsation; impulse; beat; movement.
            The measured pulse of racing oars. Tennyson.
            When the ear receives any simple sound, it is struck by a single
            pulse of the air, which makes the eardrum and the other membranous
            parts vibrate according to the nature and species of the stroke.
            Burke.
            Pulse glass, an instrument consisting to a glass tube with terminal
            bulbs, and containing ether or alcohol, which the heat of the hand
            causes to boil; — so called from the pulsating motion of the liquid
            when thus warmed. Pulse wave (Physiol.), the wave of increased
            pressure started by the ventricular systole, radiating from the
            semilunar valves over the arterial system, and gradually disappearing
            in the smaller branches.
            the pulse wave travels over the arterial system at the rate of about
            29.5 feet in a second. H. N. Martin.
