            <h2><a id="chap12"></a>L</h2>
            <p>1. L is the twelfth letter of the English alphabet, and a vocal
            consonant. It is usually called a semivowel or liquid. Its form and
            value are from the Greek, through the Latin, the form of the Greek
            letter being from the Phoenician, and the ultimate origin prob.
            Egyptian. Etymologically, it is most closely related to r and u; as
            in pilgrim, peregrine, couch (fr. collocare), aubura (fr. LL.
            alburnus).</p>
            <p>Note: At the end of monosyllables containing a single vowel, it is
            often doubled, as in fall, full, bell; but not after digraphs, as in
            foul, fool, prowl, growl, foal. In English words, the terminating
            syllable le is unaccented, the e is silent, and l is preceded by a
            voice glide, as in able, eagle, pronounced a''b'l, ''g'l. See Guide
            to Pronunciation, § 241.</p>
            <p>2. As a numeral, L stands for fifty in the English, as in the Latin
            language.
            For 50 the Romans used the Chalcidian chi, I. Taylor (The Alphabet).</p>

            acid), but the latter is optically inactive, while sarcolactic acid
            rotates the plane of polarization to the right. The third acid,
            ethylene lactic acid, accompanies sarcolactic acid in the juice of
            flesh, and is optically inactive.
             — Lactic ferment, an organized ferment (Bacterium lacticum or
            lactis), which produces lactic fermentation, decomposing the sugar of
            milk into carbonic and lactic acids, the latter, of which renders the
            milk sour, and precipitates the casein, thus giving rise to the so-
            called spontaneous coagulation of milk.

            <p>Note: Language consists in the oral utterance of sounds which usage
            has made the representatives of ideas. When two or more persons
            customarily annex the same sounds to the same ideas, the expression
            of these sounds by one person communicates his ideas to another. This
            is the primary sense of language, the use of which is to communicate
            the thoughts of one person to another through the organs of hearing.

            their feelings or their wants.</p>
            <p>6. The suggestion, by objects, actions, or conditions, of ideas
            associated therewith; as, the language of flowers.

            numbers in all coelenterates, and in a few animals of other groups.
            They are most highly developed in the tentacles of jellyfishes,
            hydroids, and Actiniæ. Each of these cells is filled with, fluid, and
            contains a long, slender, often barbed, hollow thread coiled up
            within it. When the cell contracts the thread is quickly ejected,
            being at the same time turned inside out. The thread is able to
            penetrate the flesh of various small, soft-bodied animals, and
            carries a subtle poison by which they are speedily paralyzed and
            killed. The threads, at the same time, hold the prey in position,
            attached to the tentacles. Some of the jellyfishes, as the Portuguese
            man-of-war, and Cyanea, are able to penetrate the human skin, and
            inflict painful stings in the same way. Called also nettling cell,

            <p>Defn: Any one of numerous genera and species of annulose worms,
            belonging to the order Hirudinea, or Bdelloidea, esp. those species
            used in medicine, as Hirudo medicinalis of Europe, and allied
            species.</p>
            <p>Note: In the mouth of bloodsucking leeches are three convergent,
            serrated jaws, moved by strong muscles. By the motion of these jaws a

            blood till it is gorged, and then drops off. The stomach has large
            pouches on each side to hold the blood. The common large bloodsucking
            leech of America (Macrobdella decora) is dark olive above, and red
            below, with black spots. Many kinds of leeches are parasitic on
            fishes; others feed upon worms and mollusks, and have no jaws for
            drawing blood. See Bdelloidea. Hirudinea, and Clepsine.</p>

            <p>Defn: A piece of glass, or other transparent substance, ground with
            two opposite regular surfaces, either both curved, or one curved and
            the other plane, and commonly used, either singly or combined, in
            optical instruments, for changing the direction of rays of light, and
            thus magnifying objects, or otherwise modifying vision. In practice,
            the curved surfaces are usually spherical, though rarely cylindrical,
            or of some other figure. Lenses</p>
            <p>Note: Of spherical lenses, there are six varieties, as shown in
            section in the figures herewith given: viz., a plano-concave; b
            double-concave; c plano-convex; d double-convex; converging concavo-
            convex, or converging meniscus; f diverging concavo-convex, or
            diverging meniscus. Crossed lens (Opt.), a double-convex lens with
            one radius equal to six times the other.
             — Crystalline lens. (Anat.) See Eye.
             — Fresnel lens (Opt.), a compound lens formed by placing around a
            central convex lens rings of glass so curved as to have the same
            focus; used, especially in lighthouses, for concentrating light in a
            particular direction; — so called from the inventor.
             — Multiplying lens or glass (Opt.), a lens one side of which is
            plane and the other convex, but made up of a number of plane faces
            inclined to one another, each of which presents a separate image of
            the object viewed through it, so that the object is, as it were,
            multiplied.
             — Polyzonal lens. See Polyzonal.</p>

            Lep"ro*sy, n. Etym: [See Leprous.] (Med.)
            </p>
            <p>Defn: A cutaneous disease which first appears as blebs or as reddish,
            shining, slightly prominent spots, with spreading edges. These are
            often followed by an eruption of dark or yellowish prominent nodules,
            frequently producing great deformity. In one variety of the disease,
            anæsthesia of the skin is a prominent symptom. In addition there may
            be wasting of the muscles, falling out of the hair and nails, and
            distortion of the hands and feet with destruction of the bones and
            joints. It is incurable, and is probably contagious.Mycobacterium
            leprae, curable in most cases by therapy with a combination of
            antibiotics, but cases resistant to therapy are increasing.</p>
            <p>Note: The disease now called leprosy, also designated as Lepra or
            Lepra Arabum, and Elephantiasis Græcorum, is not the same as the
            leprosy of the ancients. The latter was, indeed, a generic name for
            many varieties of skin disease (including our modern leprosy,
            psoriasis, etc.), some of which, among the Hebrews, rendered a person
            ceremonially unclean. A variety of leprosy of the Hebrews (probably
            identical with modern leprosy) was characterized by the presence of
            smooth, shining, depressed white patches or scales, the hair on which
            participated in the whiteness while the skin and adjacent flesh
            became insensible. It was incurable disease.</p>

            <p>Note: The active form of the infinitive of let, as of many other
            English verbs, is often used in a passive sense; as, a house to let
            (i. e., for letting, or to be let). This form of expression conforms
            to the use of the Anglo-Saxon gerund with to (dative infinitive)
            which was commonly so employed. See Gerund, 2. " Your elegant house
            in Harley Street is to let." Thackeray. In the imperative mood,
            before the first person plural, let has a hortative force. " Rise up,

            </p>
            <p>1. (Bot.)</p>
            <p>Defn: One of a class of cellular, flowerless plants, (technically
            called Lichenes), having no distinction of leaf and stem, usually of
            scaly, expanded, frond-like forms, but sometimes erect or pendulous
            and variously branched. They derive their nourishment from the air,
            and generate by means of spores. The species are very widely
            distributed, and form irregular spots or patches, usually of a
            greenish or yellowish color, upon rocks, trees, and various bodies,
            to which they adhere with great tenacity. They are often improperly
            called rock moss or tree moss.</p>
            <p>Note: A favorite modern theory of lichens (called after its inventor
            the Schwendener hypothesis), is that they are not autonomous plants,
            but that they consist of ascigerous fungi, parasitic on algæ. Each
            lichen is composed of white filaments and green, or greenish, rounded
            cells, and it is argued that the two are of different nature, the one
            living at the expense of the other. See Hyphæ, and Gonidia.</p>

            to deceive.
            It is willful deceit that makes a lie. A man may act a lie, as by

            the same as charging him with a lie. Every lie is an untruth, but not
            every untruth is a lie. Cf. Falsity.</p>

            <p>Note: Through ignorance or carelessness speakers and writers often
            confuse the forms of the two distinct verbs lay and lie. Lay is a
            transitive verb, and has for its preterit laid; as, he told me to lay
            it down, and I laid it down. Lie is intransitive, and has for its
            preterit lay; as, he told me to lie down, and I lay down. Some
            persons blunder by using laid for the preterit of lie; as, he told me
            to lie down, and I laid down. So persons often say incorrectly, the
            ship laid at anchor; they laid by during the storm; the book was
            laying on the shelf, etc. It is only necessary to remember, in all
            such cases, that laid is the preterit of lay, and not of lie. To lie
            along the shore (Naut.), to coast, keeping land in sight.

            licht, OHG. lioht, Goth. liuhap, Icel. lj, L. lux light, lucere to
            shine, Gr. ruc to shine. Lucid, Lunar, Luminous, Lynx.]</p>
            <p>1. That agent, force, or action in nature by the operation of which
            upon the organs of sight, objects are rendered visible or luminous.</p>
            <p>Note: Light was regarded formerly as consisting of material
            particles, or corpuscules, sent off in all directions from luminous
            bodies, and traversing space, in right lines, with the known velocity
            of about 186,300 miles per second; but it is now generally understood
            to consist, not in any actual transmission of particles or substance,
            but in the propagation of vibrations or undulations in a subtile,
            elastic medium, or ether, assumed to pervade all space, and to be
            thus set in vibratory motion by the action of luminous bodies, as the
            atmosphere is by sonorous bodies. This view of the nature of light is
            known as the undulatory or wave theory; the other, advocated by
            Newton (but long since abandoned), as the corpuscular, emission, or
            Newtonian theory. A more recent theory makes light to consist in
            electrical oscillations, and is known as the electro-magnetic theory
            of light.</p>
            <p>2. That which furnishes, or is a source of, light, as the sun, a

            xxiv. 14.</p>
            <p>4. The brightness of the eye or eyes.
            He seemed to find his way without his eyes; For out o'door he went

            Shak.</p>
            <p>5. The medium through which light is admitted, as a window, or window
            pane; a skylight; in architecture, one of the compartments of a

            bring them to light. Shak.</p>
            <p>8. The power of perception by vision.
            My strength faileth me; as for the light of my eyes, it also is gone

            <p>9. That which illumines or makes clear to the mind; mental or
            spiritual illumination; enlightenment; knowledge; information.
            He shall never know That I had any light of this from thee. Shak.</p>
            <p>10. Prosperity; happiness; joy; felicity.
            Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy health shall
            spring forth speedily. Is. lviii. 8.</p>

             — Science; learning; erudition; belles-lettres. See Science.
             — Literature, Learning, Erudition. Literature, in its widest sense,
            embraces all compositions in writing or print which preserve the
            results of observation, thought, or fancy; but those upon the
            positive sciences (mathematics, etc.) are usually excluded. It is
            often confined, however, to belles-lettres, or works of taste and
            sentiment, as poetry, eloquence, history, etc., excluding abstract
            discussions and mere erudition. A man of literature (in this
            narrowest sense) is one who is versed in belles-lettres; a man of
            learning excels in what is taught in the schools, and has a wide
            extent of knowledge, especially, in respect to the past; a man of
            erudition is one who is skilled in the more recondite branches of
            learned inquiry.
            The origin of all positive science and philosophy, as well as of all
            literature and art, in the forms in which they exist in civilized
            Europe, must be traced to the Greeks. Sir G. Lewis.
            Learning thy talent is, but mine is sense. Prior.
            Some gentlemen, abounding in their university erudition, fill their
            sermons with philosophical terms. Swift.</p>

            produces glycogen, and in other ways changes the blood which passes
            through it. In man it is situated immediately beneath the diaphragm
            and mainly on the right side. See Bile, Digestive, and Glycogen. The

            sharks known; but it has small simple teeth, and is not dangerous. It
            is captured for the sake of its liver, which often yields several
            barrels of oil. It has gill rakers, resembling whalebone, by means of
            which it separates small animals from the sea water. Called also
            basking shark, bone shark, hoemother, homer, and sailfish.

            investiture, made by the delivery of a turf, of a rod, or twig, from

            sufficient.</p>
            <p>2. Release from wardship; deliverance.
            It concerned them first to sue out their livery from the unjust
            wardship of his encroaching prerogative. Milton.</p>

            (a) The uniform clothing issued by feudal superiors to their

            gentleman are distinguished; as, a claret-colored livery.
            (c) Hence, also, the peculiar dress or garb appropriated by any
            association or body of persons to their own use; as, the livery of
            the London tradesmen, of a priest, of a charity school, etc.; also,

            fraternite. Chaucer.
            From the periodical deliveries of these characteristic articles of

            the house a cast of fine manchet [white bread], and of silver two
            great post, and white wine, and sugar. Cavendish.</p>
            <p>(f) The feeding, stabling, and care of horses for compensation;
            boarding; as, to keep one's horses at livery.
            What livery is, we by common use in England know well enough, namely,
            that is, allowance of horse meat, as to keep horses at livery, the
            which word, I guess, is derived of livering or delivering forth their
            nightly food. Spenser.
            It need hardly be observed that the explanation of livery which
            Spenser offers is perfectly correct, but . . . it is no longer
            applied to the ration or stated portion of food delivered at stated
            periods. Trench.</p>
            <p>(g) The keeping of horses in readiness to be hired temporarily for
            riding or driving; the state of being so kept.

            log, Sw. logg.] (Naut.)</p>
            <p>Defn: An apparatus for measuring the rate of a ship's motion through
            the water.</p>
            <p>Note: The common log consists of the log-chip, or logship, often
            exclusively called the log, and the log line, the former being
            commonly a thin wooden quadrant of five or six inches radius, loaded
            with lead on the arc to make it float with the point up. It is
            attached to the log line by cords from each corner. This line is
            divided into equal spaces, called knots, each bearing the same
            proportion to a mile that half a minute does to an hour. The line is
            wound on a reel which is so held as to let it run off freely. When
            the log is thrown, the log-chip is kept by the water from being drawn
            forward, and the speed of the ship is shown by the number of knots
            run out in half a minute. There are improved logs, consisting of a
            piece of mechanism which, being towed astern, shows the distance
            actually gone through by the ship, by means of the revolutions of a
            fly, which are registered on a dial plate.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Defn: One of a class of auxiliary numbers, devised by John Napier, of
            Merchiston, Scotland (1550-1617), to abridge arithmetical
            calculations, by the use of addition and subtraction in place of
            multiplication and division.</p>
            <p>Note: The relation of logarithms to common numbers is that of numbers
            in an arithmetical series to corresponding numbers in a geometrical
            series, so that sums and differences of the former indicate
            respectively products and quotients of the latter; thus
            0 1 2 3 4 Indices or logarithms 1 10 100 1000 10,000 Numbers in
            geometrical progression Hence, the logarithm of any given number is
            the exponent of a power to which another given invariable number,
            called the base, must be raised in order to produce that given
            number. Thus, let 10 be the base, then 2 is the logarithm of 100,
            because 102 = 100, and 3 is the logarithm of 1,000, because 103 =
            1,000. Arithmetical complement of a logarithm, the difference between
            a logarithm and the number ten.
             — Binary logarithms. See under Binary.

            the purpose of three entries of the common tables and one addition or
            subtraction. They were suggested by the celebrated German
            mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss (died in 1855), and are of great
            service in many astronomical computations.
             — Hyperbolic, or Napierian, logarithms, those logarithms (devised

            </p>
            <p>Note: In all air-breathing vertebrates the lungs are developed from
            the ventral wall of the esophagus as a pouch which divides into two
            sacs. In amphibians and many reptiles the lungs retain very nearly
            this primitive saclike character, but in the higher forms the
            connection with the esophagus becomes elongated into the windpipe and
            the inner walls of the sacs become more and more divided, until, in
            the mammals, the air spaces become minutely divided into tubes ending
            in small air cells, in the walls of which the blood circulates in a
            fine network of capillaries. In mammals the lungs are more or less
            divided into lobes, and each lung occupies a separate cavity in the
            thorax. See Respiration. Lung fever (Med.), pneumonia.
