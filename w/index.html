            <h2><a id="chap23"></a>W</h2>
            <p>Defn: W, the twenty-third letter of the English alphabet, is usually
            a consonant, but sometimes it is a vowel, forming the second element
            of certain diphthongs, as in few, how. It takes its written form and
            its name from the repetition of a V, this being the original form of
            the Roman capital letter which we call U. Etymologically it is most
            related to v and u. See V, and U. Some of the uneducated classes in
            England, especially in London, confuse w and v, substituting the one
            for the other, as weal for veal, and veal for weal; wine for vine,
            and vine for wine, etc. See Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 266-268.</p>

            with the champion of the demandant, who, by taking up the glove,
            accepted the challenge. The wager of battel, which has been long in
            disuse, was abolished in England in 1819, by a statute passed in
            consequence of a defendant's having waged his battle in a case which
            arose about that period. See Battel.

            Wages fund (Polit. Econ.), the aggregate capital existing at any time
            in any country, which theoretically is unconditionally destined to be
            paid out in wages. It was formerly held, by Mill and other political
            economists, that the average rate of wages in any country at any time
            depended upon the relation of the wages fund to the number of
            laborers. This theory has been greatly modified by the discovery of
            other conditions affecting wages, which it does not take into

            and is frequently impregnated with foreign matter which is mostly
            removed by distillation; hence, rain water is nearly pure. It is an

            aperture is square and the head from 4 to 9 inches above its center.
            In Europe, for experimental hydraulics, the orifice is usually round

            the resultant of all the forces exerted by gravity upon the different

            <p>WHAT<br>

            OS. hwat what, OFries. hwet, D. &amp; LG. wat, G. was, OHG. waz, hwaz,<br>
            Icel. hvat, Sw. &amp; Dan. hvad, Goth. hwa. sq. root182. See Who.]
            </p>
            <p>1. As an interrogative pronoun, used in asking questions regarding
            either persons or things; as, what is this what did you say what poem
            is this what child is lost
            What see'st thou in the ground Shak.
            What is man, that thou art mindful of him Ps. viii. 4.
            What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!
            Matt. viii. 27.</p>
            <p>Note: Originally, what, when, where, which, who, why, etc., were
            interrogatives only, and it is often difficult to determine whether
            they are used as interrogatives or relatives. What in this sense,
            when it refers to things, may be used either substantively or
            adjectively; when it refers to persons, it is used only adjectively
            with a noun expressed, who being the pronoun used substantively.</p>
            <p>2. As an exclamatory word: — (a) Used absolutely or independently; -
            - often with a question following. "What welcome be thou." Chaucer.
            What, could ye not watch with me one hour Matt. xxvi. 40.</p>

            What a piece of work is man! Shak.
            O what a riddle of absurdity! Young.</p>
            <p>Note: What in this use has a or an between itself and its noun if the
            qualitative or quantitative importance of the object is emphasized.
            (c) Sometimes prefixed to adjectives in an adverbial sense, as nearly
            equivalent to how; as, what happy boys!
            What partial judges are our and hate! Dryden.</p>
            <p>3. As a relative pronoun: —
            (a) Used substantively with the antecedent suppressed, equivalent to
            that which, or those [persons] who, or those [things] which; —
            called a compound relative.
            With joy beyond what victory bestows. Cowper.
            I'm thinking Captain Lawton will count the noses of what are left

            I know well . . . how little you will be disposed to criticise what

            <p>(b) Used adjectively, equivalent to the . . . which; the sort or kind
            of . . . which; rarely, the . . . on, or at, which.
            See what natures accompany what colors. Bacon.
            To restrain what power either the devil or any earthly enemy hath to
            work us woe. Milton.
            We know what master laid thy keel, What workmen wrought thy ribs of
            steel. Longfellow.</p>
            <p>(c) Used adverbially in a sense corresponding to the adjectival use;
            as, he picked what good fruit he saw.</p>
            <p>4. Whatever; whatsoever; what thing soever; — used indefinitely.
            "What after so befall." Chaucer.
            Whether it were the shortness of his foresight, the strength of his
            will, . . . or what it was. Bacon.</p>
            <p>5. Used adverbially, in part; partly; somewhat; — with a following
            preposition, especially, with, and commonly with repetition.
            What for lust [pleasure] and what for lore. Chaucer.

            policy, he had taken from the Christians above thirty small castles.
            Knolles.</p>
            <p>Note: In such phrases as I tell you what, what anticipates the
            following statement, being elliptical for what I think, what it is,
            how it is, etc. "I tell thee what, corporal Bardolph, I could tear
            her." Shak. Here what relates to the last clause, "I could tear her;"
            this is what I tell you. What not is often used at the close of an
            enumeration of several particulars or articles, it being an
            abbreviated clause, the verb of which, being either the same as that
            of the principal clause or a general word, as be, say, mention,
            enumerate, etc., is omitted. "Men hunt, hawk, and what not." Becon.
            "Some dead puppy, or log, orwhat not." C. Kingsley. "Battles,
            tournaments, hunts, and what not." De Quincey. Hence, the words are
            often used in a general sense with the force of a substantive,
            equivalent to anything you please, a miscellany, a variety, etc. From
            this arises the name whatnot, applied to an étagère, as being a piece
            of furniture intended for receiving miscellaneous articles of use or
            ornament. But what is used for but that, usually after a negative,
            and excludes everything contrary to the assertion in the following
            sentence. "Her needle is not so absolutely perfect in tent and cross
            stitch but what my superintendence is advisable." Sir W. Scott.
            "Never fear but what our kite shall fly as high." Ld. Lytton. What
            ho! an exclamation of calling.
             — What if, what will it matter if; what will happen or be the
            result if. "What if it be a poison" Shak.
             — What of this that it etc., what follows from this, that, it,
            etc., often with the implication that it is of no consequence. "All
            this is so; but what of this, my lord" Shak. "The night is spent,
            why, what of that" Shak.
             — What though, even granting that; allowing that; supposing it true
            that. "What though the rose have prickles, yet't is plucked." Shak.
             — What time, or What time as, when. [Obs. or Archaic] "What time I
            am afraid, I will trust in thee." Ps. lvi. 3.

            <p>Note: This mode of torture is said to have been first employed in
            Germany, in the fourteenth century. The criminal was laid on a cart
            wheel with his legs and arms extended, and his limbs in that posture
            were fractured with an iron bar. In France, where its use was
            restricted to the most atrocious crimes, the criminal was first laid
            on a frame of wood in the form of a St. Andrew's cross, with grooves
            cut transversely in it above and below the knees and elbows, and the
            executioner struck eight blows with an iron bar, so as to break the
            limbs in those places, sometimes finishing by two or three blows on
            the chest or stomach, which usually put an end to the life of the
            criminal, and were hence called coups-de-grace — blows of mercy. The
            criminal was then unbound, and laid on a small wheel, with his face
            upward, and his arms and legs doubled under him, there to expire, if
            he had survived the previous treatment. Brande.

            <p>WILL<br>
            Will, n. Etym: [OE. wille, AS. willa; akin to OFries. willa, OS.<br>
            willeo, willio, D. wil, G. wille, Icel. vili, Dan. villie, Sw. vilja,<br>
            Goth wilja. See Will, v.]
            </p>
            <p>1. The power of choosing; the faculty or endowment of the soul by
            which it is capable of choosing; the faculty or power of the mind by
            which we decide to do or not to do; the power or faculty of
            preferring or selecting one of two or more objects.
            It is necessary to form a distinct notion of what is meant by the
            word "volition" in order to understand the import of the word will,
            for this last word expresses the power of mind of which "volition" is
            the act. Stewart.
            Will is an ambiguous word, being sometimes put for the faculty of
            willing; sometimes for the act of that faculty, besides [having]
            other meanings. But "volition" always signifies the act of willing,
            and nothing else. Reid.
            Appetite is the will's solicitor, and the will is appetite's
            controller; what we covet according to the one, by the other we often
            reject. Hooker.
            The will is plainly that by which the mind chooses anything. J.
            Edwards.</p>
            <p>2. The choice which is made; a determination or preference which
            results from the act or exercise of the power of choice; a volition.
            The word "will," however, is not always used in this its proper
            acceptation, but is frequently substituted for "volition", as when I
            say that my hand mover in obedience to my will. Stewart.</p>
            <p>3. The choice or determination of one who has authority; a decree; a
            command; discretionary pleasure.
            Thy will be done. Matt. vi. 10.
            Our prayers should be according to the will of God. Law.</p>
            <p>4. Strong wish or inclination; desire; purpose.</p>
            <p>Note: "Inclination is another word with which will is frequently
            confounded. Thus, when the apothecary says, in Romeo and Juliet, —
            My poverty, but not my will, consents; . . . Put this in any liquid
            thing you will, And drink it off. the word will is plainly used as,
            synonymous with inclination; not in the strict logical sense, as the
            immediate antecedent of action. It is with the same latitude that the
            word is used in common conversation, when we speak of doing a thing
            which duty prescribes, against one's own will; or when we speak of
            doing a thing willingly or unwillingly." Stewart.</p>
            <p>5. That which is strongly wished or desired.
            What's your will, good friar Shak.
            The mariner hath his will. Coleridge.</p>
            <p>6. Arbitrary disposal; power to control, dispose, or determine.
            Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies. Ps. xxvii. 12.</p>
            <p>7
            7 (Law)</p>
            <p>Defn: The legal declaration of a person's mind as to the manner in
            which he would have his property or estate disposed of after his
            death; the written instrument, legally executed, by which a man makes
            disposition of his estate, to take effect after his death; testament;
            devise. See the Note under Testament, 1.</p>
            <p>Note: Wills are written or nuncupative, that is, oral. See
            Nuncupative will, under Nuncupative. At will (Law), at pleasure. To
            hold an estate at the will of another, is to enjoy the possession at
            his pleasure, and be liable to be ousted at any time by the lessor or
            proprietor. An estate at will is at the will of both parties.
             — Good will. See under Good.
             — Ill will, enmity; unfriendliness; malevolence.
             — To have one's will, to obtain what is desired; to do what one
            pleases.
             — Will worship, worship according to the dictates of the will or
            fancy; formal worship. [Obs.] — Will worshiper, one who offers will
            worship. [Obs.] Jer. Taylor.
             — With a will, with willingness and zeal; with all one's heart or
            strength; earnestly; heartily.</p>
            <p>WILL
            Will, v. t. &amp; auxiliary. [imp. Would. Indic. present, I will (Obs. I
            wol), thou wilt, he will (Obs. he wol); we, ye, they will.] Etym:
            [OE. willen, imp. wolde; akin to OS. willan, OFries. willa, D.
            willen, G. wollen, OHG. wollan, wellan, Icel. &amp; Sw. vilja, Dan.
            ville, Goth. wiljan, OSlav. voliti, L. velle to wish, volo I wish;
            cf. Skr. vrs to choose, to prefer. Cf. Voluntary, Welcome, Well,
            adv.]</p>
            <p>1. To wish; to desire; to incline to have.
            A wife as of herself no thing ne sholde [should] Wille in effect, but
            as her husband wolde [would]. Chaucer.
            Caleb said unto her, What will thou Judg. i. 14.
            They would none of my counsel. Prov. i. 30.</p>
            <p>2. As an auxiliary, will is used to denote futurity dependent on the
            verb. Thus, in first person, "I will" denotes willingness, consent,
            promise; and when "will" is emphasized, it denotes determination or
            fixed purpose; as, I will go if you wish; I will go at all hazards.
            In the second and third persons, the idea of distinct volition, wish,
            or purpose is evanescent, and simple certainty is appropriately
            expressed; as, "You will go," or "He will go," describes a future
            event as a fact only. To emphasize will denotes (according to the
            tone or context) certain futurity or fixed determination.</p>
            <p>Note: Will, auxiliary, may be used elliptically for will go. "I'll to
            her lodgings." Marlowe.</p>
            <p>Note: As in shall (which see), the second and third persons may be
            virtually converted into the first, either by question or indirect
            statement, so as to receive the meaning which belongs to will in that
            person; thus, "Will you go" (answer, "I will go") asks assent,
            requests, etc.; while "Will he go" simply inquires concerning
            futurity; thus, also,"He says or thinks he will go," "You say or
            think you will go," both signify willingness or consent.</p>
            <p>Note: Would, as the preterit of will, is chiefly employed in
            conditional, subjunctive, or optative senses; as, he would go if he
            could; he could go if he would; he said that he would go; I would
            fain go, but can not; I would that I were young again; and other like
            phrases. In the last use, the first personal pronoun is often
            omitted; as, would that he were here; would to Heaven that it were
            so; and, omitting the to in such an adjuration. "Would God I had died
            for thee." Would is used for both present and future time, in
            conditional propositions, and would have for past time; as, he would
            go now if he were ready; if it should rain, he would not go; he would
            have gone, had he been able. Would not, as also will not, signifies
            refusal. "He was angry, and would not go in." Luke xv. 28. Would is
            never a past participle.</p>
            <p>Note: In Ireland, Scotland, and the United States, especially in the
            southern and western portions of the United States, shall and will,
            should and would, are often misused, as in the following examples: —
            I am able to devote as much time and attention to other subjects as I
            will [shall] be under the necessity of doing next winter. Chalmers.
            A countryman, telling us what he had seen, remarked that if the
            conflagration went on, as it was doing, we would [should] have, as
            our next season's employment, the Old Town of Edinburgh to rebuild.
            H. Miller.
            I feel assured that I will [shall] not have the misfortune to find
            conflicting views held by one so enlightened as your excellency. J.
            Y. Mason.</p>
            <p>WILL<br>
            Will, v. i.
            </p>
            <p>Defn: To be willing; to be inclined or disposed; to be pleased; to
            wish; to desire.
            And behold, there came a leper and worshiped him, saying, Lord if
            thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. And Jesus . . . touched him,
            saying, I will; be thou clean. Matt. viii. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>Note: This word has been confused with will, v. i., to choose, which,
            unlike this, is of the weak conjugation. Will I, nill I, or Will ye,
            hill ye, or Will he, nill he, whether I, you, or he will it or not;
            hence, without choice; compulsorily; — sometimes corrupted into
            willy nilly. "If I must take service willy nilly." J. H. Newman.
            "Land for all who would till it, and reading and writing will ye,
            nill ye." Lowell.</p>

            </p>
            <p>1. To form a distinct volition of; to determine by an act of choice;
            to ordain; to decree. "What she will to do or say." Milton.
            By all law and reason, that which the Parliament will not, is no more
            established in this kingdom. Milton.

            <p>2. To enjoin or command, as that which is determined by an act of

            Send for music, And will the cooks to use their best of cunning To
            please the palate. Beau. &amp; Fl.
            As you go, will the lord mayor . . . To attend our further pleasure
            presently. J. Webster.</p>
            <p>3. To give or direct the disposal of by testament; to bequeath; to
            devise; as, to will one's estate to a child; also, to order or direct
            by testament; as, he willed that his nephew should have his watch.</p>

            telegraphy or telegraph (Elec.), any system of telegraphy employing
            no connecting wire or wires between the transmitting and receiving
            stations. Although more or less successful researchers were made on
            the subject by Joseph Henry, Hertz, Oliver Lodge, and others, the
            first commercially successful system was that of Guglielmo Marconi,
            patented in March, 1897. Marconi employed electric waves of high
            frequency set up by an induction coil in an oscillator, these waves
            being launched into space through a lofty antenna. The receiving
            apparatus consisted of another antenna in circuit with a coherer and
            small battery for operating through a relay the ordinary telegraphic
            receiver. This apparatus contains the essential features of all the
            systems now in use. — Wireless telephone, an apparatus or

             — Prudence; knowledge. Wisdom, Prudence, Knowledge. Wisdom has been
            defined to be "the use of the best means for attaining the best
            ends." "We conceive," says Whewell, " prudence as the virtue by which
            we select right means for given ends, while wisdom implies the
            selection of right ends as well as of right means." Hence, wisdom
            implies the union of high mental and moral excellence. Prudence (that
            is, providence, or forecast) is of a more negative character; it
            rather consists in avoiding danger than in taking decisive measures
            for the accomplishment of an object. Sir Robert Walpole was in many
            respects a prudent statesman, but he was far from being a wise one.
            Burke has said that prudence, when carried too far, degenerates into
            a "reptile virtue," which is the more dangerous for its plausible
            appearance. Knowledge, a more comprehensive term, signifies the
            simple apprehension of facts or relations. "In strictness of
            language," says Paley, " there is a difference between knowledge and
            wisdom; wisdom always supposing action, and action directed by it."
            Knowledge and wisdom, far from being one, Have ofttimes no
            connection. Knowledge dwells In heads replete with thoughts of other
            men; Wisdom, in minds attentive to their own. Knowledge, a rude,
            unprofitable mass, The mere materials with which wisdom builds, Till
            smoothed, and squared, and fitted to its place, Does but encumber
            whom it seems to enrich. Knowledge is proud that he has learned so
            much; Wisdom is humble that he knows no more. Cowper.
            Wisdom tooth, the last, or back, tooth of the full set on each half
            of each jaw in man; — familiarly so called, because appearing
            comparatively late, after the person may be supposed to have arrived
            at the age of wisdom. See the Note under Tooth, 1.</p>

            Ecclesiastes, and Wisdom of Solomon. The "wisdom" (Hokhmah) of these
            writings consists in detached sage utterances on concrete issues of
            life, without the effort at philosophical system that appeared in the
            later Hellenistic reflective writing beginning with Philo Judæus.</p>

            Who knew the wit of the Lord or who was his counselor Wyclif (Rom.<br>

            <p>2. A mental faculty, or power of the mind; — used in this sense
            chiefly in the plural, and in certain phrases; as, to lose one's

            thoughts and words; or, in other terms, thoughts and words elegantly
            adapted to the subject. Dryden.
            Wit which discovers partial likeness hidden in general diversity.

            part of Greece, I find but only two sorts of writings which the
            magistrate cared to take notice of; those either blasphemous and
            atheistical, or libelous. Milton.

            <p>Syn.
             — Ingenuity; humor; satire; sarcasm; irony; burlesque.
             — Wit, Humor. Wit primarily meant mind; and now denotes the power
            of seizing on some thought or occurrence, and, by a sudden turn,
            presenting it under aspects wholly new and unexpected — apparently
            natural and admissible, if not perfectly just, and bearing on the
            subject, or the parties concerned, with a laughable keenness and
            force. "What I want," said a pompous orator, aiming at his
            antagonist, "is common sense." "Exactly!" was the whispered reply.
            The pleasure we find in wit arises from the ingenuity of the turn,
            the sudden surprise it brings, and the patness of its application to
            the case, in the new and ludicrous relations thus flashed upon the
            view. Humor is a quality more congenial to the English mind than wit.
            It consists primarily in taking up the peculiarities of a humorist
            (or eccentric person) and drawing them out, as Addison did those of
            Sir Roger de Coverley, so that we enjoy a hearty, good-natured laugh
            at his unconscious manifestation of whims and oddities. From this
            original sense the term has been widened to embrace other sources of
            kindly mirth of the same general character. In a well-known

            <p>Note: Walker condemns the pronunciation woond as a "capricious
            novelty." It is certainly opposed to an important principle of our
            language, namely, that the Old English long sound written ou, and
            pronounced like French ou or modern English oo, has regularly
            changed, when accented, into the diphthongal sound usually written
            with the same letters ou in modern English, as in ground, hound,
            round, sound. The use of ou in Old English to represent the sound of
            modern English oo was borrowed from the French, and replaced the
            older and Anglo-Saxon spelling with u. It makes no difference whether
            the word was taken from the French or not, provided it is old enough
            in English to have suffered this change to what is now the common
            sound of ou; but words taken from the French at a later time, or
            influenced by French, may have the French sound. Wound gall (Zoöl.),
            an elongated swollen or tuberous gall on the branches of the

            <p>WRESTLING<br>
            Wres"tling, n.
            </p>
            <p>Defn: Act of one who wrestles; specif., the sport consisting of the
            hand-to-hand combat between two unarmed contestants who seek to throw
            each other. The various styles of wrestling differ in their
            definition of a fall and in the governing rules. In Greco-Roman
            wrestling, tripping and taking hold of the legs are forbidden, and a
            fall is gained (that is, the bout is won), by the contestant who pins
            both his opponent's shoulders to the ground. In catch-as-catch-can
            wrestling, all holds are permitted except such as may be barred by
            mutual consent, and a fall is defined as in Greco-Roman style.
            Lancashire style wrestling is essentially the same as catch-as-catch-
            can. In Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling the contestants stand
            chest to chest, grasping each other around the body. The one first
            losing his hold, or touching the ground with any part of his body
            except his feet, loses the bout. If both fall to the ground at the
            same time, it is a dogfall, and must be wrestled over. In the
            Cornwall and Devon wrestling, the wrestlers complete in strong loose
            linen jackets, catching hold of the jacket, or anywhere above the
            waist. Two shoulders and one hip, or two hips and one shoulder, must
            touch the ground to constitute a fall, and if a man is thrown
            otherwise than on his back the contestants get upon their feet and
            the bout recommences.</p>
