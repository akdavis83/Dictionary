            <h2><a id="chap14"></a>N</h2>
            <p>Defn: N, the fourteenth letter of English alphabet, is a vocal
            consonent, and, in allusion to its mode of formation, is called the
            dentinasal or linguanasal consonent. Its commoner sound is that heard
            in ran, done; but when immediately followed in the same word by the
            sound of g hard or k (as in single, sink, conquer), it usually
            represents the same sound as the digraph ng in sing, bring, etc. This
            is a simple but related sound, and is called the gutturo-nasal
            consonent. See Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 243-246. The letter N came
            into English through the Latin and Greek from the Phoenician, which
            probably derived it from the Egyptian as the ultimate origin. It is
            etymologically most closely related to M. See M.</p>

             — Natural philosophy, originally, the study of nature in general;
            in modern usage, that branch of physical science, commonly called
            physics, which treats of the phenomena and laws of matter and
            considers those effects only which are unaccompanied by any change of
            a chemical nature; — contrasted with mental and moral philosophy.
             — Natural scale (Mus.), a scale which is written without flats or
            sharps. Model would be a preferable term, as less likely to mislead,
            the so-called artificial scales (scales represented by the use of
            flats and sharps) being equally natural with the so-called natural
            scale — Natural science, natural history, in its broadest sense; —
            used especially in contradistinction to mental or moral science.
             — Natural selection (Biol.), a supposed operation of natural laws
            analogous, in its operation and results, to designed selection in
            breeding plants and animals, and resulting in the survival of the
            fittest. The theory of natural selection supposes that this has been
            brought about mainly by gradual changes of environment which have led
            to corresponding changes of structure, and that those forms which
            have become so modified as to be best adapted to the changed
            environment have tended to survive and leave similarly adapted
            descendants, while those less perfectly adapted have tended to die
            out though lack of fitness for the environment, thus resulting in the
            survival of the fittest. See Darwinism.
             — Natural system (Bot. &amp; Zoöl.), a classification based upon real
            affinities, as shown in the structure of all parts of the organisms,
            and by their embryology.
            It should be borne in mind that the natural system of botany is
            natural only in the constitution of its genera, tribes, orders, etc.,
            and in its grand divisions. Gray.
            — Natural theology, or Natural religion, that part of theological
            science which treats of those evidences of the existence and
            attributes of the Supreme Being which are exhibited in nature; —
            distinguished from revealed religion. See Quotation under Natural,
            a., 3.

            chambered, or divided into several cavities by simple curved
            partitions, which are traversed and connected together by a
            continuous and nearly central tube or siphuncle. See Tetrabranchiata.</p>

            and is not used as a locomotive organ, but merely serves to conduct
            water to and from the gill cavity, which contains two pairs of gills.

             — Negligence, Neglect. These two words are freely interchanged in

            general trait of character; we are guilty of neglect in particular
            cases, or in reference to individuals who had a right to our

             — Noxious; unwholesome; insalubrious; mischievous; destructive.
             — Noisome, Noxious. These words have to a great extent been
            interchanged; but there is a tendency to make a distinction between
            them, applying noxious to things that inflict evil directly; as, a
            noxious plant, noxious practices, etc., and noisome to things that
            operate with a remoter influence; as, noisome vapors, a noisome
            pestilence, etc. Noisome has the additional sense of disqusting. A
            garden may be free from noxious weeds or animals; but, if recently
            covered with manure, it may be filled with a noisome smell.</p>

            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING<br>

            <p>Defn: Without prevention, or obstruction from or by; in spite of.
            We gentil women bee Loth to displease any wight, Notwithstanding our
            great right. Chaucer's Dream.
            Those on whom Christ bestowed miraculous cures were so transported
            that their gratitude made them, notwithstanding his prohibition,
            proclaim the wonders he had done. Dr. H. More.</p>
            <p>Note: Notwithstanding was, by Johnson and Webster, viewed as a
            participle absolute, an English equivalent of the Latin non obstante.
            Its several meanings, either as preposition, adverb, or conjunction,
            are capable of being explained in this view. Later grammarians, while
            admitting that the word was originally a participle, and can be
            treated as such, prefer to class it as a preposition or disjunctive
            conjunction.</p>
            <p>Syn.
             — In spite of; despite.
             — Notwithstanding, In spite of, Despite. These words and phrases
            are often interchanged, but there is a difference between them,
            chiefly in strength. Notwithstanding is the weaker term, and simply
            points to some obstacle that may exist; as, I shall go,
            notwithstanding the rain. In spite or despite of has reference
            primarily to active opposition to be encountered from others; as,
            "I'll be, in man's despite, a monarch; " "I'll keep mine own, despite
            of all the world." Shak. Hence, these words, when applied to things,
            suppose greater opposition than notwithstanding. We should say. "He
            was thrust rudely out of doors in spite of his entreaties," rather
            than "notwithstanding". On the other hand, it would be more civil to
            say, "Notwithstanding all you have said, I must still differ with
            you."</p>
            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING

            servant. Notwithstanding, in thy days I will not do it. 1 Kings xi.
            11, 12.
            They which honor the law as an image of the wisdom of God himself,
            are, notwithstanding, to know that the same had an end in Christ.
            Hooker.
            You did wisely and honestly too, notwithstanding She is the greatest
            beauty in the parish. Fielding.
            Notwithstanding that, notwithstanding; although.

             — Novel, New . Everything at its first occurrence is new; that is

            with surprise. That is a new sight which is beheld for the first
            time; that is a novel sight which either was never seen before or is
            seen but seldom. We have daily new inventions, but a novel one
            supposes some very peculiar means of attaining its end. Novel
