            <h2><a id="chap03"></a>C</h2>
            <p>1. C is the third letter of the English alphabet. It is from the
            Latin letter C, which in old Latin represented the sounds of k, and g
            (in go); its original value being the latter. In Anglo-Saxon words,
            or Old English before the Norman Conquest, it always has the sound of
            k. The Latin C was the same letter as the Greek got it from the
            Phoenicians. The English name of C is from the Latin name ce, and was
            derived, probably, through the French. Etymologically C is related to
            g, h, k, q, s (and other sibilant sounds). Examples of these
            relations are in L. acutus, E. acute, ague; E. acrid, eagar; L.
            cornu, E. horn; E. cat, kitten; E. coy, quiet; L. circare, OF.
            cerchier, E. search.</p>

            of common time, in which each measure is a semibreve (four fourths or
            crotchets); for alla breve time it is written (c) The "C clef," a
            modification of the letter C, placed on any line of the staff, abows
            that line to be middle C.</p>
            <p>3. As a numeral, C stands for Latin centum or 100, CC for 200, etc. C

            Syn. - Junto; intrigue; plot; combination; conspiracy.
             — Cabal, Combination, Faction. An association for some purpose
            considered to be bad is the idea common to these terms. A combination
            is an organized union of individuals for mutual support, in urging
            their demands or resisting the claims of others, and may be good or
            bad according to circumstances; as, a combiniation of workmen or of
            employers to effect or to prevent a chang in prices. A cabal is a
            secret association of a few individuals who seek by cunning practices
            to obtain office and power. A faction is a larger body than a cabal,
            employed for selfish purposes in agitating the community and working
            up an excitement with a view to change the existing order of things.
            "Selfishness, insubordination, and laxity of morals give rise to
            combinations, which belong particularly to the lower orders of
            society. Restless, jealous, ambitious, and little minds are ever
            forming cabals. Factions belong especially to free governments, and
            are raised by busy and turbulent spirits for selfish porposes".

            events or disasters which produce extensive evil, either to
            communities or individuals.</p>

            exigency; downfall.
             — Calamity, Disaster, Misfortune, Mishap, Mischance. Of these
            words, calamity is the strongest. It supposes a somewhat continuous
            state, produced not usually by the direct agency of man, but by
            natural causes, such as fire, flood, tempest, disease, etc, Disaster
            denotes literally ill-starred, and is some unforeseen and distressing
            event which comes suddenly upon us, as if from hostile planet.
            Misfortune is often due to no specific cause; it is simply the bad
            fortune of an individual; a link in the chain of events; an evil
            independent of his own conduct, and not to be charged as a fault.
            Mischance and mishap are misfortunes of a trivial nature, occurring
            usually to individuals. "A calamity is either public or private, but
            more frequently the former; a disaster is rather particular than
            private; it affects things rather than persons; journey, expedition,
            and military movements are often attended with disasters; misfortunes
            are usually personal; they immediately affect the interests of the
            individual." Crabb.</p>

             — To Calculate, Compute. Reckon, Count. These words indicate the
            means by which we arrive at a given result in regard to quantity. We
            calculate with a view to obtain a certain point of knowledge; as, to
            calculate an eclipse. We compute by combining given numbers, in order
            to learn the grand result. We reckon and count in carrying out the
            details of a computation. These words are also used in a secondary
            and figurative sense. "Calculate is rather a conjection from what is,
            as to what may be; computation is a rational estimate of what has
            been, from what is; reckoning is a conclusive conviction, a pleasing
            assurance that a thing will happen; counting indicates an
            expectation. We calculate on a gain; we compute any loss sustained,
            or the amount of any mischief done; we reckon on a promised pleasure;

             — Can but, Can not but. It is an error to use the former of these
            phrases where the sens requires the latter. If we say, "I can but
            perish if I go," "But" means only, and denotes that this is all or
            the worst that can happen. When the apostle Peter said. "We can not
            but speak of the things which we have seen and heard." he referred to
            a moral constraint or necessety which rested upon him and his
            associates; and the meaning was, We cannot help speaking, We cannot
            refrain from speaking. This idea of a moral necessity or constraint
            is of frequent occurrence, and is also expressed in the phrase, "I
            can not help it." Thus we say. "I can not but hope," "I can not but
            believe," "I can not but think," "I can not but remark," etc., in
            cases in which it would be an error to use the phrase can but.
            Yet he could not but acknowledge to himself that there was something
            calculated to impress awe, . . . in the sudden appearances and
            vanishings . . . of the masque De Quincey.

            without support or embedded in the meshes of a trabecular framework.</p>
            <p>Note: Four kinds of cancers are recognized: (1) Epithelial cancer, or
            Epithelioma, in which there is no trabecular framework. See
            Epithelioma. (2) Scirrhous cancer, or Hard cancer, in which the
            framework predominates, and the tumor is of hard consistence and slow
            growth. (3) Encephaloid, Medullary, or Soft cancer, in which the
            cellular element predominates, and the tumor is soft, grows rapidy,
            and often ulcerates. (4) Colloid cancer, in which the cancerous
            structure becomes gelatinous. The last three varieties are also
            called carcinoma. Cancer cells, cells once believed to be peculiar to
            cancers, but now know to be epithelial cells differing in no respect
            from those found elsewhere in the body, and distinguished only by
            peculiarity of location and grouping.

            <p>Defn: Of, pertaining to, or obtained from, carbon; as, carbonic
            oxide. Carbonic acid (Chem.), an acid H2CO3, not existing separately,
            which, combined with positive or basic atoms or radicals, forms
            carbonates. On common language the term is very generally applied to
            a compound of carbon and oxygen, CO2, more correctly called carbon
            dioxide. It is a colorless, heavy, irrespirable gas, extinguishing
            flame, and when breathed destroys life. It can be reduced to a liquid
            and solid form by intense pressure. It is produced in the
            fermentation of liquors, and by the combustion and decomposition of
            organic substances, or other substances containing carbon. It is
            formed in the explosion of fire damp in mines, and is hance called
            after damp; it is also know as choke damp, and mephilic air. Water
            will absorb its own volume of it, and more than this under pressure,
            and in this state becomes the common soda water of the shops, and the
            carbonated water of natural springs. Combined with lime it
            constitutes limestone, or common marble and chalk. Plants imbibe it
            for their nutrition and growth, the carbon being retained and the
            oxygen given out.
             — Carbonic oxide (Chem.), a colorless gas, CO, of a light odor,
            called more correctly carbon monoxide. It is almost the only
            definitely known compound in which carbon seems to be divalent. It is
            a product of the incomplete combustion of carbon, and is an abundant
            constituent of water gas. It is fatal to animal life, extinguishes
            combustion, and burns with a pale blue flame, forming carbon dioxide.</p>

            single cell constitutes the complete individual, such being called
            unicelluter orgamisms. A typical cell is composed of a semifluid mass
            of protoplasm, more or less granular, generally containing in its
            center a nucleus which in turn frequently contains one or more
            nucleoli, the whole being surrounded by a thin membrane, the cell
            wall. In some cells, as in those of blood, in the amoeba, and in
            embryonic cells (both vegetable and animal), there is no restricting
            cell wall, while in some of the unicelluliar organisms the nucleus is
            wholly wanting. See Illust. of Bipolar. Air cell. See Air cell.

            Cen*trif"u*gal, a. Etym: [L. centrum center + fugere to flee.]
            </p>
            <p>1. Tending, or causing, to recede from the center.</p>
            <p>2. (Bot.)
            (a) Expanding first at the summit, and later at the base, as a flower
            cluster.
            (b) Having the radicle turned toward the sides of the fruit, as some
            embryos. Centrifugal force (Mech.), a force whose direction is from a
            center.</p>
            <p>Note: When a body moves in a circle with uniform velocity, a force
            must act on the body to keep it in the circle without change of
            velocity. The direction of this force is towards the center of the
            circle. If this force is applied by means of a string to the body,
            the string will be in a state of tension. To a person holding the
            other end of the string, this tension will appear to be directed
            toward the body as if the body had a tendency to move away from the
            center of the circle which it is describing. Hence this latter force
            is often called centrifugal force. The force which really acts on the
            body being directed towards the center of the circle is called
            centripetal force, and in some popular treatises the centripetal and
            centrifugal forces are described as opposing and balancing each
            other. But they are merely the different aspects of the same stress.

            </p>
            <p>Syn.
             — Vexation; mortification; peevishness; fretfulness; disgust;
            disquiet. Chagrin, Vexation, Mortification. These words agree in the
            general sense of pain produced by untoward circumstances. Vexation is
            a feeling of disquietude or irritating uneasiness from numerous
            causes, such as losses, disappointments, etc. Mortification is a
            stronger word, and denotes that keen sense of pain which results fron
            wounded pride or humiliating occurrences. Chagrin is literally the
            cutting pain produced by the friction of Shagreen leather; in its
            figurative sense, it varies in meaning, denoting in its lower degrees
            simply a state of vexation, and its higher degrees the keenest sense
            of mortification. "Vexation arises chiefly fron our wishes and views
            being crossed: mortification, from our self-importance being hurt;
            chagrin, from a mixture of the two." Crabb.</p>

            It is strictly and philosophically true in nature and reason that
            there is no such thing as chance or accident; it being evident that
            these words do not signify anything really existing, anything that is
            truly an agent or the cause of any event; but they signify merely

            <p>5. (Math.)</p>
            <p>Defn: Probability.</p>
            <p>Note: The mathematical expression, of a chance is the ratio of
            frequency with which an event happens in the long run. If an event
            may happen in a ways and may fail in b ways, and each of these a + b
            ways is equally likely, the chance, or probability, that the event
            will happen is measured by the fraction a/(a + b), and the chance, or
            probability, that it will fail is measured by b/(a + b). Chance

            </p>
            <p>Note: The chancellor was originally a chief scribe or secretary under
            the Roman emperors, but afterward was invested with judicial powers,
            and had superintendence over the other officers of the empire. From
            the Roman empire this office passed to the church, and every bishop
            has his chancellor, the principal judge of his consistory. In later
            times, in most countries of Europe, the chancellor was a high officer
            of state, keeper of the great seal of the kingdom, and having the
            supervision of all charters, and like public instruments of the
            crown, which were authenticated in the most solemn manner. In France
            a secretary is in some cases called a chancellor. In Scotland, the
            appellation is given to the foreman of a jury, or assize. In the
            present German empire, the chancellor is the president of the federal
            council and the head of the imperial administration. In the United
            States, the title is given to certain judges of courts of chancery or
            equity, established by the statutes of separate States. Blackstone.

            of chancery, the highest judicial officer of the crown, and the first

            <p>CHANCERY
            Chan"cer*y, n. Etym: [F. chancellerie, LL. cancellaria, from L.
            cancellarius. See Chancellor, and cf. Chancellery.]</p>
            <p>1. In England, formerly, the highest court of judicature next to the
            Parliament, exercising jurisdiction at law, but chiefly in equity;
            but under the jurisdiction act of 1873 it became the chancery
            division of the High Court of Justice, and now exercises jurisdiction
            only in equity.</p>
            <p>2. In the Unites States, a court of equity; equity; proceeding in
            equity.</p>
            <p>Note: A court of chancery, so far as it is a court of equity, in the
            English and American sense, may be generally, if not precisely,
            described as one having jurisdiction in cases of rights, recognized
            and protected by the municipal jurisprudence, where a plain,
            adequate, and complete remedy can not be had in the courts of common
            law. In some of the American States, jurisdiction at law and in
            equity centers in the same tribunal. The courts of the United States
            also have jurisdiction both at law and in equity, and in all such
            cases they exercise their jurisdiction, as courts of law, or as
            courts of equity, as the subject of adjudication may require. In
            others of the American States, the courts that administer equity are
            distinct tribunals, having their appropriate judicial officers, and
            it is to the latter that the appellation courts of chancery is
            usually applied; but, in American law, the terms equity and court of
            equity are more frequently employed than the corresponding terms
            chancery and court of chancery. Burrill. Inns of chancery. See under
            Inn.
             — To get (or to hold) In chancery (Boxing), to get the head of an

            to the condition of a person involved in the chancery court, where he
            was helpless, while the lawyers lived upon his estate.</p>

            <p>Syn.
             — Clearness, Perspicuity. Clearness has reference to our ideas, and
            springs from a distinct conception of the subject under
            consideration. Perspicuity has reference to the mode of expressing
            our ideas and belongs essentially to style. Hence we speak of a
            writer as having clear ideas, a clear arrangement, and perspicuous
            phraseology. We do at times speak of a person's having great
            clearness of style; but in such cases we are usually thinking of the
            clearness of his ideas as manifested in language. "Whenever men think

            <p>CLOUD
            Cloud, n. Etym: [Prob. fr. AS. cld a rock or hillock, the application
            arising from the frequent resemblance of clouds to rocks or hillocks
            in the sky or air.]</p>
            <p>1. A collection of visible vapor, or watery particles, susponded in
            the upper atmosphere.
            I do set my bow in the cloud. Gen. ix. 13.</p>
            <p>Note: A classification of clouds according to their chief forms was
            first proposed by the meteorologist Howard, and this is still
            substantially employed. The following varieties and subvarieties are
            recognized: (a) Cirrus. This is the most elevated of all the forms of
            clouds; is thin, long-drawn, sometimes looking like carded wool or
            hair, sometimes like a brush or room, sometimes in curl-like or
            fleecelike patches. It is the cat's-tail of the sailor, and the
            mare's-tail of the landsman. (b) Cumulus. This form appears in large
            masses of a hemispherical form, or nearly so, above, but flat below,
            one often piled above another, forming great clouds, common in the
            summer, and presenting the appearance of gigantic mountains crowned
            with snow. It often affords rain and thunder gusts. (c) Stratus. This
            form appears in layers or bands extending horizontally. (d) Nimbus.
            This form is characterized by its uniform gray tint and ragged edges;
            it covers the sky in seasons of continued rain, as in easterly
            storms, and is the proper rain cloud. The name is sometimes used to
            denote a raining cumulus, or cumulostratus. (e) Cirro-cumulus. This
            form consists, like the cirrus, of thin, broken, fleecelice clouds,
            but the parts are more or less rounded and regulary grouped. It is
            popularly called mackerel sky. (f) Cirro-stratus. In this form the
            patches of cirrus coalesce in long strata, between cirrus and
            stratus. (g) Cumulo-stratus. A form between cumulus and stratus,
            often assuming at the horizon a black or bluish tint.
             — Fog, cloud, motionless, or nearly so, lying near or in contact
            with the earth's surface.
             — Storm scud, cloud lying quite low, without form, and driven
            rapidly with the wind.</p>
            <p>2. A mass or volume of smoke, or flying dust, resembling vapor. "A
            thick cloud of incense." Ezek. viii. 11.</p>
            <p>3. A dark vein or spot on a lighter material, as in marble; hence, a
            blemish or defect; as, a cloud upon one's reputation; a cloud on a
            title.</p>
            <p>4. That which has a dark, lowering, or threatening aspect; that which
            temporarily overshadows, obscures, or depresses; as, a cloud of
            sorrow; a cloud of war; a cloud upon the intellect.</p>
            <p>5. A great crowd or multitude; a vast collection. "So great a cloud
            of witnesses." Heb. xii. 1.</p>
            <p>6. A large, loosely-knitted scarf, worn by women about the head.
            Cloud on a (or the) title (Law), a defect of title, usually

            legislation.

            </p>
            <p>1. To restrain by force, especially by law or authority; to repress;<br>
            to curb. Burke.<br>
            Punishments are manifold, that they may coerce this profligate sort.<br>
            Ayliffe.
            </p>
            <p>2. To compel or constrain to any action; as, to coerce a man to vote
            for a certain candidate.</p>
            <p>3. To compel or enforce; as, to coerce obedience.</p>
            <p>Syn.
             — To Coerce, Compel. To compel denotes to urge on by force which
            cannot be resisted. The term aplies equally to physical and moral
            force; as, compelled by hunger; compelled adverse circumstances;
            compelled by parental affection. Coerce had at first only the
            negative sense of checking or restraining by force; as, to coerce a
            bad man by punishments or a prisoner with fetters. It has now gained
            a positive sense., viz., that of driving a person into the
            performance of some act which is required of him by another; as, to
            coerce a man to sign a contract; to coerce obedience. In this sense
            (which is now the prevailing one), coerce differs but little from
            compel, and yet there is a distinction between them. Coercion is
            usually acomplished by indirect means, as threats and intimidation,
            physical force being more rarely employed in coercing.</p>

            <p>COERCION<br>
            Co*er"cion, n. Etym: [L. coercio, fr. coercere. See Coerce.]
            </p>
            <p>1. The act or process of coercing.</p>
            <p>2. (Law)</p>
            <p>Defn: The application to another of either physical or moral force.
            When the force is physical, and cannot be resisted, then the act
            produced by it is a nullity, so far as concerns the party coerced.
            When the force is moral, then the act, though voidable, is imputable
            to the party doing it, unless he be so paralyzed by terror as to act
            convulsively. At the same time coercion is not negatived by the fact
            of submission under force. "Coactus volui" (I consented under
            compulsion) is the condition of mind which, when there is volition
            forced by coercion, annuls the result of such coercion. Wharton.</p>

            Coercive power can only influence us to outward practice. Bp.
            Warburton.
            Coercive or Coercitive force (Magnetism), the power or force which in
            iron or steel produces a slowness or difficulty in imparting
            magnetism to it, and also interposes an obstacle to the return of a
            bar to its natural state when active magnetism has ceased. It plainly
            depends on the molecular constitution of the metal. Nichol.
            The power of resisting magnetization or demagnization is sometimes
            called coercive force. S. Thompson.</p>

            have been called — a fourth estate of the realm. Macaulay.</p>

            dichromate and exposed to light under a reversed negative. After the
            dichromate has been washed out, the film is soaked in glycerin and
            water. As this treatment causes swelling in those parts of the film
            which have been acted on by light, a plate results from which
            impressions can be taken with prepared ink. The albertype, phototype,
            and heliotype are collotypes.</p>

            objects are apprehended in vision; as, gay colors; sad colors, etc.</p>

            red, shorter waves green, and those still shorter blue, etc. White,
            or ordinary, light consists of waves of various lengths so blended as
            to produce no effect of color, and the color of objects depends upon
            their power to absorb or reflect a greater or less proportion of the

            venire (gvenire), Gr. gam. *23. Cf. Base, n., Convene, Adventure.]</p>
            <p>1. To move hitherward; to draw near; to approach the speaker, or some
            place or person indicated; — opposed to go.

            <p>Note: Am come, is come, etc., are frequently used instead of have
            come, has come, etc., esp. in poetry. The verb to be gives adjectival
            significance to the participle as expressing a state or condition of
            the subject, while the auxiliary have expresses simply the completion
            of the action signified by the verb.

            the person addressed; as, I shall come home next week; he will come
            to your house to-day. It is used with other verbs almost as an
            auxiliary, indicative of approach to the action or state expressed by
            the verb; as, how came you to do it Come is used colloquially, with
            reference to a definite future time approaching, without an
            auxilliary; as, it will be two years, come next Christmas; i. e.,
            when Christmas shall come.
            They were cried In meeting, come next Sunday. Lowell.
            Come, in the imperative, is used to excite attention, or to invite to
            motion or joint action; come, let us go. "This is the heir; come, let
            us kill him." Matt. xxi. 38. When repeated, it sometimes expresses
            haste, or impatience, and sometimes rebuke. "Come, come, no time for

            </p>
            <p>Syn.
             — To cheer; solace; console; revive; encourage; enliven;
            invigorate; inspirit, gladden; recreate; exhilarate; refresh;
            animate; confirm; strengthen.
             — To Comfort, Console, Solace. These verbs all suppose some
            antecedent state of suffering or sorrow. Console in confined to the
            act giving sympathetic relief to the mind under affliction or sorrow,
            and points to some definite source of that relief; as, the presence
            of his friend consoled him; he was much consoled by this
            intelligence. The act of consoling commonly implies the inculcation
            of resignation. Comfort points to relief afforded by the
            communication of positive pleasure, hope, and strength, as well as by
            the diminution of pain; as, "They brought the young man alive, and
            were not a little comforted." Acts xx. 12.</p>
            <p>Note: Solace is from L. solacium, which means according to Dumesnil,
            consolation inwardly felt or applied to the case of the sufferer.
            Hence, the verb to solace denotes the using of things for the purpose
            of affording relief under sorrow or suffering; as, to solace one's
            self with reflections, with books, or with active employments.</p>

            affords consolation.<br>

            aid and comfort to the enemy.</p>
            <p>Syn.<br>
             — Comfort, Consolation. Comfort has two meanings:
            </p>
            <p>1. Strength and relief received under affliction;</p>
            <p>2. Positive enjoyment, of a quiet, permanent nature, together with
            the sources thereof; as, the comfort of love; surrounded with
            comforts; but it is with the former only that the word consolation is
            brought into comparison. As thus compared, consolation points to some
            specific source of relief for the afflicted mind; as, the
            consolations of religion. Comfort supposes the relief to be afforded
            by imparting positive enjoyment, as well as a diminution of pain.
            "Consolation, or comfort, signifies some alleviation to that pain to
            which it is not in our power to afford the proper and adequate
            remedy; they imply rather an augmentation of the power of bearing,
            than a diminution of the burden." Johnson.</p>

            <p>4. In a condition of comfort; having comforts; not suffering or
            anxious; hence, contented; cheerful; as, to lead a comfortable life.

             — To Communicate, Impart, Reveal. Communicate is the more general
            term, and denotes the allowing of others to partake or enjoy in
            common with ourselves. Impart is more specific. It is giving to
            others a part of what we had held as our own, or making them our
            partners; as, to impart our feelings; to impart of our property, etc.

            concealed; as, to reveal a secret.</p>

            Whosoever, therefore, shall confess me before men, him will I
            confess, also, before my Father which is in heaven. Matt. x. 32.
            For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel,

             — Admit; grant; concede; avow; own; assent; recognize; prove;
            exhibit; attest.
             — To Confess, Acknowledge, Avow. Acknowledge is opposed to conceal.
            We acknowledge what we feel must or ought to be made known. (See
            Acknowledge.) Avow is opposed to withhold. We avow when we make an
            open and public declaration, as against obloquy or opposition; as, to
            avow one's principles; to avow one's participation in some act.
            Confess is opposed to deny. We confess (in the ordinary sense of the
            word) what we feel to have been wrong; as, to confess one's errors or
            faults. We sometimes use confess and acknowledge when there is no
            admission of our being in the wrong; as, this, I confess, is my
            opinion; I acknowledge I have always thought so; but in these cases
            we mean simply to imply that others may perhaps think us in the
            wrong, and hence we use the words by way of deference to their
            opinions. It was in this way that the early Christians were led to
            use the Latin confiteor and confessio fidei to denote the public
            declaration of their faith in Christianity; and hence the
            corresponding use in English of the verb confess and the noun
            confession.</p>

            overwhelm by evidence which puts an end to the case and leaves an
            opponent nothing to say; to silence; as, "the atheist is confuted by
            the whole structure of things around him."</p>

            It is the king's most sweet pleasure and affection to congratulate
            the princess at her pavilion. Shak.

            consider one's self happy or fortunate.</p>
            <p>Syn.
             — To Congratulate, Felicitate. To felicitate is simply to wish a
            person joy. To congratulate has the additional signification of
            uniting in the joy of him whom we congratulate. Hence they are by no
            means synonymous. One who has lost the object of his affections by
            her marriage to a rival, might perhaps felicitate that rival on his
            success, but could never be expected to congratulate him on such an
            event.
            Felicitations are little better than compliments; congratulations are
            the expression of a genuine sympathy and joy. Trench.</p>

            to overcome by force of arms; to cause to yield; to vanquish. "If
            thou conquer Rome." Shak.
            If we be conquer'd, let men conquer us. Shak.
            We conquered France, but felt our captive's charms. Pope.</p>
            <p>2. To subdue or overcome by mental or moral power; to surmount; as,

            <p>Syn.
             — To subdue; vanquish; overcome; overpower; overthrow; defeat;
            rout; discomfit; subjugate; reduce; humble; crush; surmount; subject;
            master.
             — To Conquer, Vanquish, Subdue, Subjugate, Overcome. These words
            agree in the general idea expressed by overcome, — that of bringing
            under one's power by the exertion of force. Conquer is wider and more
            general than vanquish, denoting usually a succession of conflicts.
            Vanquish is more individual, and refers usually to a single conflict.
            Thus, Alexander conquered Asia in a succession of battles, and
            vanquished Darius in one decisive engagement. Subdue implies a more
            gradual and continual pressure, but a surer and more final
            subjection. We speak of a nation as subdued when its spirit is at
            last broken, so that no further resistance is offered. Subjugate is
            to bring completely under the yoke of bondage. The ancient Gauls were
            never finally subdued by the Romans until they were completely
            subjugated. These words, when used figuratively, have correspondent
            meanings. We conquer our prejudices or aversions by a succesion of
            conflicts; but we sometimes vanquish our reluctance to duty by one
            decided effort: we endeavor to subdue our evil propensities by
            watchful and persevering exertions. Subjugate is more commonly taken
            in its primary meaning, and when used figuratively has generally a
            bad sense; as, his reason was completely subjugated to the sway of
            his passions.</p>

            As science means knowledge, conscience etymologically means self-

            <p>1. A high officer in the monarhical establishments of the Middle
            Ages.</p>
            <p>Note: The constable of France was the first officer of the crown, and
            had the chief ommand of the army. It was also his duty to regulate
            all matters of chivalry. The office was suppressed in 1627. The
            constable, or lord high constable, of England, was one of the highest
            officers of the crown, commander in chief of the forces, and keeper
            of the peace of the nation. He also judicial cognizance of many
            important matters. The office was as early as the Conquest, but has
            been disused (except on great and solemn occasions), since the
            attainder of Stafford, duke of Buckingham, in the reign of Henry
            VIII.</p>

            <p>Note: In England, at the present time, the constable is a conservator
            of the peace within his district, and is also charged by various
            statutes with other duties, such as serving summons, precepts,
            warrants, etc. In the United States, constables are town or its
            officers of the peace, with powers similar to those of the constables
            of England. In addition to their duties as conservators of the peace,
            they are invested with others by statute, such as to execute civil as
            well as criminal process in certain cases, to attend courts, keep
            juries, etc. In some cities, there are officers called high
            constables, who act as shiefs of the constabulary or police force. In
            other cities the title of constable, as well as the office, is merged
            in that of the polie officer. High constable, a constable having
            certain duties and powers within a hundred. [Eng.] — Petty

            <p>Syn.
             — Contagious, Infectious. These words have been used in very
            diverse senses; but, in general, a contagious disease has considered
            as one which is caught from another by contact, by the breath, by
            bodily effluvia, etc.; while an infectious disease supposes some
            entirely different cause acting by a hidden influence, like the
            miasma of prison ships, of marshes, etc., infecting the system with
            disease. "This distinction, though not universally admitted by
            medical men, as to the literal meaning, of the words, certainly
            applies to them in their figurative use. Thus we speak of the
            contagious influence of evil associates; their contagion of bad
            example, the contagion of fear, etc., when we refer to transmission
            by proximity or contact. On the other hand, we speak of infection by
            bad principles, etc., when we consider anything as diffused by some
            hidden influence.</p>

            Most such diseases have already been proved to be germ diseases, and
            their communicability depends on the transmission of the living
            germs.  Many germ diseases are not contagious, some special method of
            transmission or inoculation of the germs being required.</p>

             — Contemptible, Despicable, Pitiful, Paltry. Despicable is stronger
            than contemptible, as despise is stronger than contemn. It implies
            keen disapprobation, with a mixture of anger. A man is despicable
            chiefly for low actions which mark his life, such as servility,
            baseness, or mean adulation. A man is contemptible for mean qualities
            which distinguish his character, especially those which show him to
            be weak, foolish, or worthless. Treachery is despicable, egotism is
            contemptible. Pitiful and paltry are applied to cases which are
            beneath anger, and are simply contemptible in a high degree.</p>

            contumelious.
             — Contemptuous, Contemptible. These words, from their similarity of
            sound, are sometimes erroneously interchanged, as when a person
            speaks of having "a very contemptible opinion of another."
            Contemptible is applied to that which is the object of contempt; as,
            contemptible conduct; acontemptible fellow. Contemptuous is applied
            to that which indicates contempts; as, a contemptuous look; a
            contemptuous remark; contemptuous treatment. A person, or whatever is
            personal, as an action, an expression, a feeling, an opinion, may be
            either contemptuous or contemptible; a thing may be contemptible, but
            can not be contemptuous.</p>

            subject is to be divided and defined. Bagehot.
            This was my original contention, and I still maintain that you should
            abide by your former decision. Jowett.</p>
            <p>Syn.
             — Struggle; strife; contest; quarrel; combat; conflict; feud;
            litigation; controversy; dissension; variance; disagreement; debate;
            competition; emulation.
             — Contention, Strife. A struggle between two parties is the idea
            common to these two words. Strife is a struggle for mastery;
            contention is a struggle for the possession of some desired object,
            or the accomplishment of some favorite end. Neither of the words is
            necessairly used in a bad sense, since there may be a generous strife
            or contention between two friends as to which shall incur danger or
            submit to sacrifices. Ordinarily, however, these words denote a
            struggle arising from bad passions. In that case, strife usually
            springs from a quarrelsome temper, and contention from, a selfish
            spirit which seeks its own aggrandizement, or is fearful lest others
            should obtain too such. Strife has more reference to the manner than
            to the object of a struggle, while contention takes more account of
            the end to be gained.</p>

            altercation; debate; controvesy; difference; disagreement; strife.
             — Contest, Conflict, Combat, Encounter. Contest is the broadest
            term, and had originally no reference to actual fighting. It was, on
            the contrary, a legal term signifying to call witnesses, and hence
            came to denote first a struggle in argument, and then a struggle for
            some common object between opposing parties, usually one of
            considerable duration, and implying successive stages or acts.
            Conflict denotes literally a close personal engagement, in which
            sense it is applied to actual fighting. It is, however, more commonly
            used in a figurative sense to denote strenuous or direct opposition;
            as, a mental conflict; conflicting interests or passions; a conflict
            of laws. An encounter is a direct meeting face to face. Usually it is
            a hostile meeting, and is then very nearly coincident with conflict;
            as, an encounter of opposing hosts. Sometimes it is used in a looser
            sense; as, "this keen encounter of our wits." Shak. Combat is
            commonly applied to actual fighting, but may be used figuratively in
            reference to a strife or words or a struggle of feeling.</p>

             — Continuous, Continual. Continuous is the stronger word, and
            denotes that the continuity or union of parts is absolute and
            uninterrupted; as, a continuous sheet of ice; a continuous flow of
            water or of argument. So Daniel Webster speaks of "a continuous and
            unbroken strain of the martial airs of England." Continual, in most
            cases, marks a close and unbroken succession of things, rather than
            absolute continuity. Thus we speak of continual showers, implying a
            repetition with occasional interruptions; we speak of a person as
            liable to continual calls, or as subject to continual applications
            for aid, etc. See Constant.</p>

             — Proselyte; neophyte.
             — Convert, Proselyte, Pervert. A convert is one who turns from what
            he believes to have been a decided error of faith or practice. Such a
            change may relate to religion, politics, or other subjects. properly
            considered, it is not confined to speculation alone, but affects the
            whole current of one's feelings and the tenor of his actions. As such
            a change carries with it the appearance of sincerity, the term
            convert is usually taken in a good sense. Proselyte is a term of more
            ambiguous use and application. It was first applied to an adherent of
            one religious system who had transferred himself externally to some
            other religious system; and is also applied to one who makes a
            similar transfer in respect to systems of philosophy or speculation.
            The term has little or no reference to the state of the heart.
            Pervert is a term of recent origin, designed to express the contrary
            of convert, and to stigmatize a person as drawn off perverted from
            the true faith. It has been more particulary applied by members of
            the Church of England to those who have joined the Roman Catholic
            Church.</p>

            understanding; to persuade, of the will or feelings. The one is
            effected by argument, the other by motives. There are cases, however,
            in which persuade may seem to be used in reference only to the assent
            of the understanding; as when we say, I am persuaded it is so; I can
            not persuade myself of the fact. But in such instances there is
            usually or always a degree of awakened feeling which has had its
            share in producing the assent of the understanding.</p>

            F. corporation corporation.]
            </p>
            <p>Defn: A body politic or corporate, formed and authorized by law to
            act as a single person, and endowed by law with the capacity of
            succession; a society having the capacity of transacting business as
            an individual.</p>
            <p>Note: Corporations are aggregate or sole. Corporations aggregate
            consist of two or more persons united in a society, which is
            preserved by a succession of members, either forever or till the
            corporation is dissolved by the power that formed it, by the death of
            all its members, by surrender of its charter or franchises, or by
            forfeiture. Such corporations are the mayor and aldermen of cities,
            the head and fellows of a college, the dean and chapter of a
            cathedral church, the stockholders of a bank or insurance company,
            etc. A corporation sole consists of a single person, who is made a
            body corporate and politic, in order to give him some legal
            capacities, and especially that of succession, which as a natural
            person he can not have. Kings, bishops, deans, parsons, and vicars,
            are in England sole corporations. A fee will not pass to a
            corporation sole without the word "successors" in the grant. There
            are instances in the United States of a minister of a parish seized
            of parsonage lands in the right of his parish, being a corporation
            sole, as in Massachusetts. Corporations are sometimes classified as
            public and private; public being convertible with municipal, and
            private corporations being all corporations not municipal. Close
            corporation. See under Close.</p>

             — Courage, Bravery, Fortitude, Intrepidity, Gallantry, Valor.
            Courage is that firmness of spirit and swell of soul which meets
            danger without fear. Bravery is daring and impetuous courage, like
            that of one who has the reward continually in view, and displays his
            courage in daring acts. Fortitude has often been styled "passive
            courage," and consist in the habit of encountering danger and
            enduring pain with a steadfast and unbroken spirit. Valor is courage
            exhibited in war, and can not be applied to single combats; it is
            never used figuratively. Intrepidity is firm, unshaken courage.
            Gallantry is adventurous courage, which courts danger with a high and
            cheerful spirit. A man may show courage, fortitude, or intrepidity in
            the common pursuits of life, as well as in war. Valor, bravery, and
            gallantry are displayed in the contest of arms. Valor belongs only to
            battle; bravery may be shown in single combat; gallantry may be
            manifested either in attack or defense; but in the latter ease, the
            defense is usually turned into an attack.</p>

            <p>Syn.
             — Agreement; contract; compact; bargain; arrangement; stipulation.
             — Covenant, Contract, Compact, Stipulation. These words all denote
            a mutual agreement between two parties. Covenant is frequently used
            in a religious sense; as, the covenant of works or of grace; a church
            covenant; the Solemn League and Covenant. Contract is the word most
            used in the business of life. Crabb and Taylor are wrong in saying
            that a contract must always be in writing. There are oral and implied
            contracts as well as written ones, and these are equally enforced by
            law. In legal usage, the word covenant has an important place as
            connected with contracts. A compact is only a stronger and more
            solemn contract. The term is chiefly applied to political alliances.
            Thus, the old Confederation was a compact between the States. Under
            the present Federal Constitution, no individual State can, without
            consent of Congress, enter into a compact with any other State or
            foreign power. A stipulation is one of the articles or provisions of
            a contract.</p>

            Louisiana, or one of the States adjoining, bordering on the Gulf of
            of Mexico.</p>
            <p>Note: "The term creole negro is employed in the English West Indies
            to distinguish the negroes born there from the Africans imported
            during the time of the slave trade. The application of this term to
            the colored people has led to an idea common in some parts of the
            United States, though wholly unfounded, that it implies an admixture
            greater or less of African blood." R. Hildreth.</p>
            <p>Note: "The title [Creole] did not first belong to the descendants of
            Spanish, but of French, settlers, But such a meaning implied a
            certain excellence of origin, and so came early to include any native
            of French or Spanish descent by either parent, whose nonalliance with
            the slave race entitled him to social rank. Later, the term was
            adopted by, not conceded to, the natives of mixed blood, and is still
            so used among themselves. . . . Besides French and Spanish, there are
            even, for convenience of speech, 'colored' Creoles; but there are no
            Italian, or Sicilian, nor any English, Scotch, Irish, or 'Yankee'

            impurity or exposure. It is a complex mixture of various phenols and
            their ethers, and is obtained by the distillation of wood tar,
            especially that of beechwood.</p>
            <p>Note: It is remarkable as an antiseptic and deodorizer in the
            preservation of wood, flesh, etc., and in the prevention of
            putrefaction; but it is a poor germicide, and in this respect has
            been overrated. Smoked meat, as ham, owes its preservation and taste
            to a small quantity of creosote absorbed from the smoke to which it
            is exposed. Carbolic acid is phenol proper, while creosote is a
            mixture of several phenols. Coal-tar creosote (Chem.), a colorless or
            yellow, oily liquid, obtained in the distillation of coal tar, and

            were originally capitally punished (murder, rape, robbery, arson,
            burglary, and larceny), as distinguished from misdemeanors, which are
            offenses of a lighter grade. See Misdemeanors.</p>
            <p>3. Any great wickedness or sin; iniguity.
            Nocrime was thine, if 'tis no crime to love. Pope.</p>
            <p>4. That which occasion crime. [Obs.]
            The tree of life, the crime of our first father's fall. Spenser.
            Capital crime, a crime punishable with death.</p>
            <p>Syn.
             — Sin; vice; iniquity; wrong.
             — Crime, Sin,Vice. Sin is the generic term, embracing wickedness of
            every kind, but specifically denoting an offense as committed against
            God. Crime is strictly a violation of law either human or divine; but
            in present usage the term is commonly applied to actions contrary to
            the laws of the State. Vice is more distinctively that which springs
            from the inordinate indulgence of the natural appetites, which are in
            themselves innocent. Thus intemperance, unchastity, duplicity, etc.,
            are vices; while murder, forgery, etc., which spring from the
            indulgence of selfish passions, are crimes.</p>

            <p>1. (Chem. &amp; Min.)</p>
            <p>Defn: The act or process by which a substance in solidifying assumes
            the form and sructure of a crystal, or becomes crystallized.</p>
            <p>2. The body formed by crystallizing; as, silver on precipitation
            forms arborescent crystallizations.</p>
            <p>Note: The systems of crystallization are the several classes to which
            the forms are mathematically referable. They are most simply
            described according to the relative lengths and inclinations of
            certain assumed lines called axes; but the real distinction is the
            degree of symmetry characterizing them. 1. The Isometric, or
            Monometric, system has the axes all equal, as in the cube,
            octahedron, etc. 2. The Tetragonal, or Dimetric, system has a varying
            vertical axis, while the lateral are equal, as in the right square
            prism. 3. The Orthorhombic, or Trimetric, system has the three axes
            unequal, as in the rectangular and rhombic prism. In this system, the
            lateral axes are called, respectively, macrodiagonal and
            brachydiagonal.
             — The preceding are erect forms, the axes intersecting at right
            angles. The following are oblique. 4. The Monoclinic system, having
            one of the intersections oblique, as in the oblique rhombic prism. In
            this system, the lateral axes are called respectively, clinodiagonal
            and orthodiagonal. 5. The Triclinic system, having all the three
            intersections oblique, as in the oblique rhomboidal prism. There is
            also: 6. The Hexagonal system (one division of which is called
            Rhombohedral), in which there are three equal lateral axes, and a
            vertical axis of variable length, as in the hexagonal prism and the
            rhombohedron.</p>
            <p>Note: The Diclinic system, sometimes recognized, with two oblique
            intersections, is only a variety of the Triclinic.</p>

             — Cunning, Artful, Sly, Wily, Crafty. These epithets agree in
            expressing an aptitude for attaining some end by peculiar and secret
            means. Cunning is usually low; as, a cunning trick. Artful is more
            ingenious and inventive; as, an artful device. Sly implies a turn for
            what is double or concealed; as, sly humor; a sly evasion. Crafty
            denotes a talent for dexterously deceiving; as, a crafty manager.
            Wily describes a talent for the use of stratagems; as, a wily
            politician. "Acunning man often shows his dexterity in simply
            concealing. An artful man goes further, and exerts his ingenuity in
            misleading. A crafty man mingles cunning with art, and so shapes his
            actions as to lull suspicions. The young may be cunning, but the
            experienced only can be crafty. Slyness is a vulgar kind of cunning;
            the sly man goes cautiously and silently to work. Wiliness is a
            species of cunning or craft applicable only to cases of attack and
            defence." Crabb.</p>
