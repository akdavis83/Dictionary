            Yaz"oo Fraud. (U. S. Hist.)
            </p>
            <p>Defn: The grant by the State of Georgia, by Act of Jan. 7, 1795, of
            35,000,000 acres of her western territory, for $500,000, to four
            companies known as the Yazoo Companies from the region granted ; —
            commonly so called, the act being known as the Yazoo Frauds Act,
            because of alleged corruption of the legislature, every member but
            one being a shareholder in one or more of the companies. The act
            granting the land was repealed in 1796 by a new legislature, and the
            repealing provision was incorporated in the State constitution in
            1798. In 1802 the territory was ceded to the United States. The
            claims of the purchasers, whom Georgia had refused to compensate,
            were sustained by the United States Supreme Court, which (1810)
            declared the repealing act of 1796 unconstitutional. Congress in 1814
            ordered the lands sold and appropriated $5,000,000 to pay the claims.</p>

            <p>Note: "The fine distinction between `yea' and `yes,' `nay' and `no,'
            that once existed in English, has quite disappeared. `Yea' and `nay'
            in Wyclif's time, and a good deal later, were the answers to
            questions framed in the affirmative. `Will he come' To this it would
            have been replied, `Yea' or `Nay', as the case might be. But, `Will
            he not come' To this the answer would have been `Yes' or `No.' Sir
            Thomas More finds fault with Tyndale, that in his translation of the
            Bible he had not observed this distinction, which was evidently
            therefore going out even then, that is, in the reign of Henry VIII.;
            and shortly after it was quite forgotten." Trench.</p>
