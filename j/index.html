            <h2><a id="chap10"></a>J</h2>
            <p>Defn: . J is the tenth letter of the English alphabet. It is a later
            variant form of the Roman letter I, used to express a consonantal
            sound, that is, originally, the sound of English y in yet. The forms
            J and I have, until a recent time, been classed together, and they
            have been used interchangeably.</p>
            <p>Note: In medical prescriptions j is still used in place of i at the
            end of a number, as a Roman numeral; as, vj, xij. J is etymologically
            most closely related to i, y, g; as in jot, iota; jest, gesture;
            join, jugular, yoke. See I. J is a compound vocal consonant, nearly
            equivalent in sound to dzh. It is exactly the same as g in gem. See
            Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 179, 211, 239.</p>

            <p>Defn: A stone, commonly of a pale to dark green color but sometimes
            whitish. It is very hard and compact, capable of fine polish, and is
            used for ornamental purposes and for implements, esp. in Eastern
            countries and among many early peoples.</p>
            <p>Note: The general term jade includes nephrite, a compact variety of
            tremolite with a specific gravity of 3, and also the mineral jadeite,
            a silicate of alumina and soda, with a specific gravity of 3.3. The
            latter is the more highly prized and includes the feitsui of the

             — To fatigue; tire; weary; harass.

            denotes fatigue which wastes the strength; weary implies that a
            person is worn out by exertion; jade refers to the weariness created
            by a long and steady repetition of the same act or effort. A little
            exertion will tire a child or a weak person; a severe or protracted
            task wearies equally the body and the mind; the most powerful horse
            becomes jaded on a long journey by a continual straining of the same
            muscles. Wearied with labor of body or mind; tired of work, tired out

            <p>Defn: A particular form of Vishnu, or of Krishna, whose chief idol
            and worship are at Puri, in Orissa. The idol is considered to contain
            the bones of Krishna and to possess a soul. The principal festivals
            are the Snanayatra, when the idol is bathed, and the Rathayatra, when
            the image is drawn upon a car adorned with obscene paintings.
            Formerly it was erroneously supposed that devotees allowed themselves
            to be crushed beneath the wheels of this car. It is now known that
            any death within the temple of Jagannath is considered to render the
            place unclean, and any spilling of blood in the presence of the idol
            is a pollution.</p>

            </p>
            <p>1. (R. C. Ch.)</p>
            <p>Defn: One of a religious order founded by Ignatius Loyola, and
            approved in 1540, under the title of The Society of Jesus.</p>
            <p>Note: The order consists of Scholastics, the Professed, the Spiritual
            Coadjutors, and the Temporal Coadjutors or Lay Brothers. The Jesuit
            novice after two years becomes a Scholastic, and takes his first vows
            of poverty, chastity, and obedience simply. Some years after, at the
            close of a second novitiate, he takes his second vows and is ranked
            among the Coadjutors or Professed. The Professed are bound by a
            fourth vow, from which only the pope can dispense, requiring them to
            go wherever the pope may send them for missionary duty. The
            Coadjutors teach in the schools, and are employed in general
            missionary labors. The Society is governed by a General who holds
            office for life. He has associated with him "Assistants" (five at the
            present time), representing different provinces. The Society was
            first established in the United States in 1807. The Jesuits have
            displayed in their enterprises a high degree of zeal, learning, and
            skill, but, by their enemies, have been generally reputed to use art
            and intrigue in promoting or accomplishing their purposes, whence the
            words Jesuit, Jesuitical, and the like, have acquired an opprobrious
            sense.</p>

            <p>JEWISH CALENDAR<br>
            Jew"ish cal"en*dar.
            </p>
            <p>Defn: A lunisolar calendar in use among Hebraic peoples, reckoning
            from the year 3761 b. c., the date traditionally given for the
            Creation. It received its present fixed form from Hillel II. about
            360 a. d. The present names of the months, which are Babylonian-
            Assyrian in origin, replaced older ones, Abib, Bul, etc., at the time
            of the Babylonian Exile. Nineteen years constitute a lunar cycle, of
            which the 3d, 6th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 19th years are leap
            years. The year 5663 [1902-3 a. d.] was the first year of the 299th
            lunar cycle. The common year is said to be defective, regular, or
            perfect (or abundant) according as it has 353, 354, or 355 days. The
            leap year has an intercalary month, and a total of 383 (defective),
            384 (regular), or 385 (perfect, or abundant) days. The calendar is
            complicated by various rules providing for the harmonious arrangement
            of festivals, etc., so that no simple perpetual calendar can be
            constructed. The following table gives the months in order, with the
            number of days assigned to each. Only three months vary in length.
            They are: Heshvan, which has 30 days in perfect years; Kislev, which
            has 30 days in regular and perfect years; and Adar, which has 30 days
            in leap years. The ecclesiastical year commences with Nisan and the
            civil year with Tishri. The date of the first of Tishri, or the
            Jewish New Year, is also given for the Jewish years 5661-5696 (1900-
            1935 a. d.). From these tables it is possible to transform any Jewish
            date into Christian, or vice versa, for the years 1900-1935 a. d.</p>

             — Tour; excursion; trip; expedition; pilgrimage.
             — Journey, Tour, Excursion, Pilgrimage. The word journey suggests
            the idea of a somewhat prolonged traveling for a specific object,
            leading a person to pass directly from one point to another. In a
            tour, we take a roundabout course from place to place, more commonly
            for pleasure, though sometimes on business. An excursion is usually a
            brief tour or trip for pleasure, health, etc. In a pilgrimage we
            travel to a place hallowed by our religions affections, or by some
            train of sacred or tender associations. A journey on important
            business; the tour of Europe; an excursion to the lakes; a pilgrimage

             — Julian epoch, the epoch of the commencement of the Julian
            calendar, or 46 b. c.

            the solar, lunar, and indiction cycles (28 x 19 x 15 = 7,980), being
            reckoned from the year 4713 B. C., when the first years of these
            several cycles would coincide, so that if any year of the period be
            divided by 28, 19, or 15, the remainder will be the year of the
            corresponding cycle. The Julian period was proposed by Scaliger, to
            remove or avoid ambiguities in chronological dates, and was so named
            because composed of Julian years.
             — Julian year, the year of 365 days, 6 hours, adopted in the Julian

             — Justice, Equity, Law. Justice and equity are the same; but human
            laws, though designed to secure justice, are of necessity imperfect,
            and hence what is strictly legal is at times far from being equitable
            or just. Here a court of equity comes in to redress the grievances.
            It does so, as distinguished from courts of law; and as the latter
            are often styled courts of justice, some have fancied that there is
            in this case a conflict between justice and equity. The real conflict
            is against the working of the law; this a court of equity brings into
            accordance with the claims of justice. It would be an unfortunate use
            of language which should lead any one to imagine he might have
            justice on his side while practicing iniquity (inequity). Justice,
            Rectitude. Rectitude, in its widest sense, is one of the most
            comprehensive words in our language, denoting absolute conformity to
            the rule of right in principle and practice. Justice refers more
            especially to the carrying out of law, and has been considered by
            moralists as of three kinds: (1) Commutative justice, which gives
            every man his own property, including things pledged by promise. (2)
            Distributive justice, which gives every man his exact deserts. (3)
            General justice, which carries out all the ends of law, though not in
            every case through the precise channels of commutative or
